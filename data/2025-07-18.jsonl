These regimes correspond\nto varying levels of kinematic constraints, ranging from classical elasticity\nto a fully relaxed model. The holonomic case reduces to a higher-order\nEuler--Bernoulli beam model, while the semi-holonomic case generalises the\nTimoshenko beam model. The non-holonomic case provides a unified framework that\nnaturally incorporates both dislocations and disclinations. Furthermore, the\nholonomic and semi-holonomic models are shown to emerge as singular limits of\nthe non-holonomic model by increasing specific penalty coefficients. Simplified\nordinary differential equation systems are derived for specific cases, such as\npure traction and bending, illustrating the practical applicability of the\nmodels.
