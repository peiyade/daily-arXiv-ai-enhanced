We show the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions to\nthe system under the smallness assumptions of given data, where the Lipschitz\ncontinuity of the solution mapping and the asymptotic stability of the solution\nare also shown. The proof is based on maximal regularity results for the linear\nheat equation and the Stokes system, where we establish a new maximal\nregularity theorem for some linear heat equation with an inhomogeneous Neumann\nboundary condition.

The mean values of the\nkinetic system recover a SIR-type model with reinfection, where the macroscopic\nparameters are explicitly derived from the underlying microscopic interaction\nrules.
