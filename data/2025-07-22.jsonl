To achieve this,\nwe utilize the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient along with a detailed analysis of\nthe fibering maps associated with the energy functional. Additionally, we study\nthe asymptotic behavior of the weak solutions to the main problem as $\\lambda\n\\to 0$ or $\\mu \\to +\\infty$."}

We\nprove that an approximation of finitely many spectral data on $U$ determines a\nfinite metric space that is close to $(M,g)$ in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology,\nand further determines a discrete function that approximates the potential $q$\nwith uniform estimates.
