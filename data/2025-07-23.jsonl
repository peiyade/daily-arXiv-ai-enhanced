Our\nmethod is a combination of a conformal patching argument, the finite energy\nexistence theorem in Lorenz gauge on Minkowski space of Selberg and Tesfahun, a\ncareful localization of finite energy data, and null form estimates of\nFoschi-Klainerman type. Although we prove that the energy-carrying components\nof the solution maintain regularity, due to the incompleteness of the null\nstructure in Lorenz gauge and the nature of our foliation-change arguments we\nfind small losses of regularity in both the scalar field and the potential."}
