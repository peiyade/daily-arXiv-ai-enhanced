Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior as time\napproaches infinity and show that the temperature stabilizes to a constant\nstate, while the displacement naturally decomposes into two distinct\ncomponents: a divergence-free part oscillating indefinitely according to a\nhomogeneous wave equation and a curl-free part converging to zero. Analogous\nresults for the Lam\\'e operator are also stated."}

We first consider the case of the linear\ndiffusion equation and establish such results in arbitrary dimensions, by using\na straightforward adaptation of the classical arguments used for the\nhomogenization of highly oscillatory problems posed on fixed (non-thin)\ndomains. We next consider the linear elasticity problem, which raises\nchallenging difficulties in its full generality. Under some classical\nassumptions on the symmetries of the elasticity tensor, the problem can be\nsplit into two independent problems, the membrane problem and the bending\nproblem. Focusing on two-dimensional problems, we show that the membrane case\ncan actually be addressed using a careful adaptation of classical arguments. In\nthe bending case, the scheme of the proof used in the membrane and diffusion\ncases can however not be straightforwardly adapted. In that bending case, we\nestablish the desired strong convergence results by using a different strategy\nof proof, which seems, up to our knowledge, to be new."}

Our main estimate controls the $L^\\infty$ norm of $F(u)$ in a\nball, where $F$ is a primitive of $f$, by only the $L^1$ norm of $u$ in a\nlarger ball.\n  Under the same assumptions, we also give global estimates in dimensions\n$n\\leq 6$ for the Dirichlet problem with vanishing boundary condition,\nimproving previously known results.
