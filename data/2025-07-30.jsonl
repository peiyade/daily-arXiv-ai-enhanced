For many systems, the\ninteraction between the agents is restricted to an underlying network structure\nand often, the latter also evolves in time with its dynamics coupled to the\nevolution of the particles. Due to their relevance for applications such\nsystems on adaptive or co-evolutionary networks have received increasing\ninterest in recent years. In particular, a fundamental question concerns the\nbehaviour of the system in the infinite particle limit.

We\nspecifically address the case with non-convex constitutive stress relations and\nnon-degenerate Lax's shock. Under the assumptions of suitably small initial\nperturbations satisfying a zero-mass type condition, we prove that the solution\nof the system converges to a viscous shock profile with a shift, which is\npartially determined by the space-periodic perturbation. Notably, our result\nimposes no amplitude restrictions on the viscous shock waves. This work extends\nthe result of Kawashima-Matsumura (\\textit{Commun. Pure Appl. Math.}\n\\textbf{47}, 1994) by simultaneously handling both large-amplitude shocks and\nspace-periodic perturbations, while also generalizing the result of Huang-Yuan\n(\\textit{Commun. Math. Phys.} \\textbf{387}, 2021) by allowing for a non-convex\nconstitutive relation. The key ingredient of proof is decomposing the\nlarge-amplitude shock wave into small-amplitude shocks and, for each,\nintroducing suitable transform and weight functions to counteract the adverse\neffects of non-convex constitutive relations encountered during weighted energy\nestimates on the system in effective velocity and deformation gradient\nvariables."}

Under mild boundedness and regularity conditions on $ f_1 $\nand $ f_2 $ the system is shown to exhibit bi-stability in the form of two\nstable stationary heterogeneous background states. These background states can\nbe connected by stationary and travelling front solutions. Travelling fronts\nfeature an interface that moves with a non-uniform speed through the motionless\nspatially varying background states it connects. As a result, unlike classical\ntravelling waves, these fronts are not stationary in any co-moving frame. We\nconstruct both the background states and stationary fronts using an extension\nof Fenichel theory to the non-compact case. Additionally, we establish the\nexistence of travelling front solutions and derive a leading-order expression\nfor the dynamic position of the moving interface through a non-autonomous\nspatial dynamics approach. This expression takes the form of a\ndelay-differential equation, and its accuracy is validated through numerical\nsimulations. A key contribution of our work lies in the general treatment of $\nf_1 $ and $ f_2 $, which are neither (necessarily) asymptotically small nor\nrestricted to specific forms such as periodic or localised structures.\nFurthermore, our derivation of the front position formula circumvents the\ntraditional reliance on spectral analysis, enabling us to describe front\ndynamics beyond bifurcations from stationary fronts. This approach has the\npotential to be extended to other settings in which spectral properties at\nonset preclude conventional reduction techniques."}
