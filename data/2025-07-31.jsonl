Part III: From mathematical results to engineering application", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper concludes a three-part effort aimed at developing a consistent and\nunified framework for the phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture. Building\non the theoretical foundations established in the first two parts, which\nincluded a $\\Gamma$-convergence result for a broad class of phase-field energy\nfunctionals and the presentation of a rigorous analytical methodology for\nconstructing models tailored to specific cohesive laws, this third paper\nexplores the mechanical response of phase-field models, most of which are\nnovel, associated with different cohesive fracture behaviors within a\none-dimensional framework. Particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of\nformulating distinct phase-field models that, despite exhibiting different\nevolutions of their phase-field and displacement profiles, yield identical\ncohesive fracture responses. Thus, this work aims at providing a practical\ninterpretation of the mathematical framework connecting the theoretical\ninsights established in the previous parts for physical relevant applications."}

When the corner domain is\napproximated by more regular domains, then higher order Sobolev norms of the\nsolutions on these domains can blow up in the limit. We study this blow-up in\nthe simple example of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet conditions in two\nsituations: The rounding of a corner in any dimension, and the two-dimensional\nsituation where a polygonal corner is replaced by two or more corners with\nsmaller angles. We show how an inner expansion derived from a more general\nrecent result on converging expansions into generalized power series can be\nemployed to prove simple and explicit estimations for Sobolev norms and\nsingularity coefficients by powers of the approximation scale."}

Specifically, we establish two general uniqueness results for the\nrecovery of a potential in the stationary Schr\\\"odinger operator from partial\nspectral data, which consists of a possibly sparse subset of its eigenvalues\nand the restrictions of the corresponding eigenfunctions to a nonempty open\nsubset of the manifold. Crucially, the eigenfunctions are not assumed to be\northogonal, and no information about global norming constants is required.\n  The partial data formulation of our inverse spectral problems is naturally\nsuited to the analysis of inverse problems with passive measurements, where\nonly limited observational access to the solution is available. Leveraging this\nstructure, we establish generic uniqueness results for a broad class of\nevolutionary PDEs, in which both the coefficients and the initial or source\ndata are to be recovered from knowledge of the solution restricted to a subset\nof spacetime. These results introduce a spectral framework for passive imaging\nand extend inverse spectral theory into a regime characterized by highly\nincomplete, yet physically realistic, data."}
