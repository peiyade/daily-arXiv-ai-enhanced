While it is known that propagation of chaos holds at\nrate $O(N^{-1})$ uniformly in time, and Gibbs relaxation at rate $O(e^{-ct})$\nuniformly in $N$, we go a step further by showing that the cross error between\nchaos propagation and Gibbs relaxation is $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. For\ntranslation-invariant systems on the torus, this leads to an improved\nmean-field approximation error at the level of the one-particle density: the\nerror decreases from $O(N^{-1})$ to $O(N^{-1}e^{-ct})$. Our approach relies on\na detailed analysis of the BBGKY hierarchy for correlation functions, and\napplies to both underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics with merely\nbounded interaction forces. We also derive new results on Gibbs relaxation and\npresent partial extensions beyond the weak interaction regime."}
