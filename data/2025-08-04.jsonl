These solutions have compelling properties such as finite $L^2$-norm\ncontrasted with anomalously slow temporal decay in the absence of coherent\nstructures. In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of general\nrogue waves of infinite order in a parametric limit in which the solution\nbecomes small uniformly on compact sets while the $L^2$-norm remains fixed. We\nshow that the solution is primarily concentrated on one side of a specific\ncurve in logarithmically rescaled space-time coordinates, and we obtain the\nleading-order asymptotic behavior of the solution in this region in terms of\nelliptic functions as well as near the boundary curve in terms of modulated\nsolitons. The asymptotic formula captures the fixed $L^2$-norm even as the\nsolution becomes uniformly small."}
