This new approach involves: (1)\nconstructing an abstract framework using semigroups and generators; (2)\nformulating a corresponding mean-field evolution problem, and proving its\nwell-posedness; (3) demonstrating the propagation of chaos for a class of\nN-particle systems associated with the mean-field model. Our results are\nreadily applicable to various mean-field models. To demonstrate this, we apply\nour findings to obtain a new result for Levy-type mean-field systems, which\nencompass the McKean-Vlasov diffusion."}

Quantitative bounds for the matrix coefficients\narising in the Gabor wave packet decomposition of such operators are\nestablished, revealing precise exponential decay rates together with subtler\ndispersive and spreading phenomena. To this aim, we present several novel\nresults concerning the time-frequency analysis of functions with controlled\nGelfand-Shilov regularity, which are of independent interest. As a byproduct,\nwe generalize Vemuri's Gaussian confinement results for the solutions of the\nquantum harmonic oscillator in two respects, namely by encompassing general\nexponential decay rates as well as arbitrary quadratic Schr\\\"odinger\npropagators. In particular, we extensively discuss some prominent models such\nas the harmonic oscillator, the free particle in a constant magnetic field and\nfractional Fourier transforms."}

Adopting an iterative procedure, taking\nadvantage of the special structure of the equations and using a novel\ncombination of two different interpolation inequalities, we establish Liouville\ntype theorems if the smooth solution satisfies certain growth conditions in\nterms of $L^p$-norms on the annuli. Compared with the velocity field and the\nmagnetic field, we raise the most relaxed restriction for the angular velocity.\nMore specifically, we allow $L^q$-norm of the angular velocity on the annuli to\ngrow polynomially at any degree. Besides, we also obtain Liouville type\ntheorems for the 3D stationary micropolar fluid equations."}
