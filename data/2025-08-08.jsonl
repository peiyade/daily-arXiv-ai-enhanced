Employing asymptotic techniques with respect to the domain's thickness,\nwe rigorously derive the effective nonlinear two-dimensional Reynolds model\ndescribing the fluid flow. The mathematical analysis is based on deriving the\nsharp a priori estimates and proving the compactness results of the rescaled\nfunctions together with monotonicity arguments. The resulting limit model\nincorporates contributions of the oscillating boundary and thus, it could prove\nuseful in the applications involving this lubrication regime."}

In particular, we show that a scatterer\nwith either a small support or high-curvature boundary points must radiate at\nany frequency.

Furthermore, we\nreveal new geometric properties of elastic transmission eigenfunctions. To\nderive a quantitative relationship between the intensity of a radiating or\nnon-radiating source and the diameter of its support, we utilize the Helmholtz\ndecomposition, the translation-invariant $L^2$-norm estimate for the Lam\\'e\noperator, and global energy estimates.
