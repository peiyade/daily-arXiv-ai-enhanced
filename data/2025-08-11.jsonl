Unlike the classical identity that relates the time derivative of\nthe squared norm to the inner product of the derivative and the function\nitself, its fractional analogue typically requires a regularity condition that\nis difficult to verify in practice. We revisit this inequality in the setting\nof square integrable functions over an open domain and provide a new proof\nbased solely on the assumption that the solution is essentially bounded in\ntime. In our approach, the required regularity emerges naturally within the\nargument, rather than being imposed beforehand. This refinement expands the\nscope of applicability of the inequality and offers a rigorous foundation for\nusing the Faedo Galerkin method in problems governed by fractional evolution\nequations. As an application, we prove existence, uniqueness, and regularity of\nweak solutions to the fractional heat equation."}
