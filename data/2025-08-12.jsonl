Unfortunately, this\nproperty does not hold for more general semigroups. In this paper, we exhibit a\nslightly weaker notion of log-concavity that can be propagated along\ngeneralised heat semigroups. As a consequence, we obtain logsemiconcavity\nproperties for the ground state of Schr{\\\"o}dinger operators for non-convex\npotentials, as well as propagation of functional inequalities along generalised\nheat flows. We then investigate the preservation of weak log-concavity by\nconditioning and marginalisation, following the seminal works of Brascamp and\nLieb. To our knowledge, our results are the first of this type in non\nlog-concave settings. We eventually study generation of log-concavity by\nparabolic regularisation and prove novel two-sided log-Hessian estimates for\nthe fundamental solution of parabolic equations with unbounded coefficients,\nwhich can be made uniform in time.

We show that, under a mild coercivity condition, the kernel\nof the effective tensor of the mixture is equal to the orthogonal complement of\nthe homotopy classes of closed paths in the supporting set. This shows that a\nperiodic planar network has positive definite effective tensor, i.e., it is\nresilient to fluctuations, if and only if the network is reticulate. We provide\na geometric characterization of the upper attainability by applying a\ntransformation from varifolds to matrix-valued measures. We show that this\ntransformation leads to an equivalence between two distinct notions from\nmaterial science and geometric measure theory respectively: conductance\nmaximality and area criticality. Based on this relation we show a pointwise\ndimension bound for mixtures that attain the upper Wiener bound by applying a\nfractional version of the monotonicity formula for stationary varifolds.
