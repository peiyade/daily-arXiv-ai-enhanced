By exploiting the stabilizing effect induced by the\nbackground magnetic field and constructing a hierarchy of four energy\nfunctionals, we establish global-in-time uniform bounds that are independent of\nthe viscosity in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and the vertical resistivity. A\nkey innovation in our analysis is the development of a two-tier energy method,\nwhich couples the boundedness of conormal derivatives with the decay of\ntangential derivatives. These global conormal regularity estimates, together\nwith sharp decay rates, enable us to rigorously justify the vanishing\ndissipation limit and derive explicit long-time convergence rates to the MHD\nsystem with vanishing dissipation in the $x_2$ and $x_3$ directions and no\nvertical magnetic diffusion. In the absence of a magnetic field, the\nglobal-in-time vanishing viscosity limit for the 3D incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations with anisotropic dissipation remains a challenging open\nproblem. This work reveals the mechanism by which the magnetic field enhances\ndissipation and stabilizes the fluid dynamics in the vanishing viscosity limit."}

Our proof is based\non the method of normal form reduction (NFR), which has been employed to obtain\nthe uniqueness in $C_tH^s_x$, $s>1/2$. To overcome logarithmic divergences at\nthe $H^{1/2}$ regularity, we exploit the $B^{0+}_{\\infty,1}$ control of\nsolutions provided by a refined Strichartz estimate. Our NFR argument consists\nof two stages: we first use NFR finitely many times to derive an intermediate\nequation in which the main cubic nonlinearity is restricted to a certain type\nof frequency interaction; we then apply the infinite NFR scheme to the\nintermediate equation. Moreover, we modify the usual NFR argument relying on\ncontinuity in time of solutions so that the uniqueness in the class\n$L^\\infty_tH^{1/2}_x$ can be obtained directly."}

Global existence of strong\nsolutions with bounded and strictly positive density for this system was proven\nby Giorgini and Temam \\cite{GT}; however, an additional smoothness assumption\non the initial density was needed to prove uniqueness in \\cite{GT1}. Whether\nuniqueness holds without this additional assumption has remained an open\nquestion. The present work solves this question and we finally establish\nuniqueness of the strong solution in the framework in \\cite{GT}. Our method\nrelies on some extra time weighted estimates and the Lagrangian approach."}

This condition is derived from a second-order ordinary differential\nequation whose solution produces a barrier that appears to be novel in the\ncontext of barrier constructions. It admits an explicit formulation and, in the\nsetting of Hadamard manifolds, reveals a direct and transparent relationship\nbetween the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the boundary data\nrequired for solvability. The condition also extends naturally to unbounded\ndomains. In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but\nalso less restrictive than the classical Jenkins - Serrin criterion, ensuring\nthe existence of solutions in situations where that approach fail. Furthermore,\nunlike the Jenkins-Serrin condition, our appproach separates the geometric\nproperties of the domain from its boundary data, providing a clearer and more\nmanageable framework for solvability analysis."}
