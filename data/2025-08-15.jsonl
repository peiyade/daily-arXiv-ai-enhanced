We establish existence of solutions without assuming\neither decay at spatial infinity or spatial periodicity. One obstacle is that\nfor $L^{\\infty}$ data, the constitutive law may not be applicable, as Riesz\ntransforms are unbounded. However, for $L^{\\infty}$ initial data for which the\nconstitutive law does converge, we demonstrate that there exists a unique\nsolution locally in time, and that the constitutive law continues to hold at\npositive times. In the case that $\\alpha\\in(\\frac{1}{2},1]$ and that the\ninitial data has some smoothness (specifically, if the data is in $C^{2}$), we\ndemonstrate a maximum principle and show that this unique solution is actually\nclassical and global in time. Then, a density argument allows us to show that\nmild solutions with only $L^{\\infty}$ data are also global in time, and also\npossess this maximum principle. Finally, we introduce a related problem in\nwhich we replace the usual constitutive law for the surface quasi-geostrophic\nequation with a generalization of Sertfati type, and prove the same results for\nthis relaxed model."}

By means of time-incremental\nminimisation and generalised contractivity estimates, we establish the global\nwell-posedness of the Cauchy problem for moderately regular initial data. For\ngeneral finite-energy data we obtain the existence of gradient-flow solutions\nand a stability estimate of weak-strong type. We further study the asymptotic\nbehaviour for relaxation time and bulk modulus depending on a small parameter.\nDepending on the scaling, we recover the Cahn-Hilliard, the mass-conserving\nAllen-Cahn or the viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation.
