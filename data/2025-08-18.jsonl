These functionals appears as relaxation of $F(u,\\Omega):=\\int_\\Omega\nf(\\nabla u)dx$, where $u:\\Omega\\rightarrow \\mathbb R^m$, and $f$ is polyconvex.\nIn constrast with the case of relaxation with respect to the standard\n$L^1$-convergence, in the case that $\\Omega$ is $2$-dimensional, we prove that\nthe sets map $A\\mapsto F(u,A)$ for $A$ open, is, for every $u\\in\nBV(\\Omega;\\mathbb R^m)$, $m\\geq1$, the restriction of a Borel measure. This is\nnot true in the case $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb R^n$, with $n\\geq3$.

Firstly, we localize and\ntranslate the Laplace--Beltrami problem into flat domains to establish\n$\\mathrm{L}^p$-based ($2 \\leq p < \\infty$) Sobolev regularity results as a\nconsequence of the powerful Calder\\'{o}n-Zygmund theory. From then onwards, our\nstrategy is purely ``variational'', building upon the abstract functional\nanalytic idea of ``duality'' and classical results such as the\nBanach--Ne\\v{c}as--Babu\\v{s}ka theorem and the generalized Babu\\v{s}ka--Brezzi\ntheory in reflexive Banach spaces to analyze and relate to each other different\nstrong, weak and ultra-weak formulations for the aforementioned problems. In\nparticular, by exploiting the lack of manifold boundary, we are able to\ndecouple the velocity and the pressure unknowns in the tangent Stokes problem\nto establish their higher-regularity $\\mathbf{W}^{k,p} \\times\n\\mathrm{W}^{k-1,p}$ ($k \\geq 2$) as a consequence of the $\\mathrm{L}^p$-based\nwell-posedness and regularity theory for the Laplace--Beltrami and\nBochner--Laplace operators. We finish this work by applying this newly derived\nregularity theory to: i) define and appropriate Stokes operator and study its\nspectral and regularity properties, ii) establish $\\mathrm{L}^p$-based\n($1<p<\\infty$) existence and well-posedness for the (stationary) tangent Oseen\nand Navier--Stokes equations via a Galerkin method and bootstrapping, and\nhigher $\\mathrm{L}^p$-based Sobolev regularity results. iii) transfer our\nregularity results to other choices of vector Laplace operators."}
