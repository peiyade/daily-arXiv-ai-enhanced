The structure consists of a thick layer modeled by the Biot\nequations and a thin reticular plate with inertia and elastic energy,\ntransparent to fluid flow. The coupling is nonlinear in the sense that it takes\nplace on a moving interface that is not known a priori but is defined by the\nsolution itself, making the problem a moving-boundary problem. This nonlinear\nfree-boundary coupling, combined with the limited regularity of the Biot\ndisplacement, renders the classical weak formulation ill-defined at finite\nenergy. To address this, we introduce a minimally invasive regularization based\non a suitable extension and convolution of the Biot displacement, chosen so\nthat the regularized problem remains consistent with the original model. We\nthen construct approximate solutions to the regularized problem via a Lie\noperator-splitting scheme and derive uniform energy bounds. While these bounds\nensure weak and weak* convergence, passing to the limit in the nonlinear terms\nrequires refined compactness arguments, including variants of the Aubin-Lions\nlemma and tools adapted to moving non-Lipschitz interfaces. The result applies\nin particular to the purely elastic case (without structural damping) as well\nas the poroviscoelastic case. This work extends the two-dimensional analysis of\nKuan-\\v{C}ani\\'c-Muha 2024 to the fully three-dimensional setting and, to our\nknowledge, provides the first existence result for a nonlinearly coupled,\nmultilayer 3D Navier-Stokes-Biot FSI system with a permeable interface."}

Peet"], "title": "A State-Space Representation of Coupled Linear Multivariate PDEs and Stability Analysis using SDP", "comment": null, "summary": "Physical processes evolving in both time and space are often modeled using\nPartial Differential Equations (PDEs). Recently, it has been shown how\nstability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can\nbe more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation\n(PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on\nan analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator,\n$\\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper,\nwe show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to\nmultiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of\nlifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain\nis well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which\nis necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate\nspatial differential operator,\n$D^\\alpha=\\partial_{s_1}^{\\alpha_1}\\cdots\\partial_{s_N}^{\\alpha_N}$, on the PDE\ndomain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra\nof Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable\nkernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any\nsuitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE,\nparameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for\nPDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of\npositive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the\nprocess of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is\nused to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining\naccurate bounds on the rate of decay."}
