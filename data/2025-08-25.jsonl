Characterizing these blowup singularities analytically is\nthe key to understanding the emergence and persistence of spiking synchrony in\nmean-field neural models. Such a treatment is possible via time change\ntechniques for a Poissonian variation of the classically considered\nintegrate-and-fire dynamics. However, just as for shock solutions for nonlinear\nconservation laws, there are several admissible blowup solutions to the\ncorresponding McKean-Vlasov equations. Because of this ambiguity, it is unclear\nwhich notion of blowup solutions shall be adopted. Here, we unambiguously\ndefine physical blowup dynamics as solutions to a fixed-point problem bearing\non the time change associated to the McKean-Vlasov equation. To justify the\nphysicality of this formulation, we introduce a buffering mechanism that\nregularizes blowup dynamics, while satisfying the same conservation principles\nas the finite-dimensional particle-system dynamics. We then show that physical\nblowup dynamics are recovered from these regularized solutions in the limit of\nvanishing buffering. Our approach also shows that these physical solutions are\nunique, globally defined, and avoid the so-called eternal blowup phenomenon, as\nlong as the neurons exhibit nonzero, distributed refractory periods, a\nreasonable modeling assumption."}

A defining feature of active matter systems is that a substantial portion\nof their dynamics takes place near confining boundaries. In our previous work,\nwe developed a kinetic framework that enables direct computation of the\nprobability distribution functions for both the position and orientation of\nactive rods. A distinguishing aspect of this approach is its explicit treatment\nof wall accumulation through the use of two coupled probability distribution\nfunctions: one describing the bulk population and the other representing rods\naccumulated at the boundary. Another novel feature is the structure of the\ngoverning equation, which is degenerate: it is second-order in one non-temporal\nvariable and first-order in another. The main focus of this paper is to\nrigorously justify this model via multi-scale analysis. We first establish\nwell-posedness of the system and then employ two distinct multi-scale\nderivations to obtain the model as a singular limit of a more classical kinetic\nsystem in the regime of vanishing translational diffusion.

Thus, it is tacitly\nassumed that if the discrete state propagation and resulting mean state\nestimates are accurate, then the ensemble-based discrete covariance propagation\nwill be accurate as well, apart from sampling errors due to limited ensemble\nsize. Through a series of numerical experiments supported by analytical\nresults, we demonstrate that this assumption is false when correlation length\nscales approach grid resolution. We show for states that satisfy advective\ndynamics, that while the discrete state propagation and ensemble mean state\nestimates are accurate, the corresponding ensemble covariances can be\nremarkably inaccurate, well beyond that expected from sampling errors or\ntypical numerical discretization errors. The underlying problem is a\nfundamental discrepancy between discrete covariance propagation and the\ncontinuum covariance dynamics, which we can identify because the exact\ncontinuum covariance dynamics are known. Errors in the ensemble covariances,\nwhich can be at least one order of magnitude larger than those of the mean\nstate when correlation lengths begin to approach grid scale, cannot be\nrectified by the usual methods, such as covariance inflation and localization.\nThis work brings to light a fundamental problem for data assimilation schemes\nthat propagate covariances using the same discrete dynamical model used to\npropagate the state."}
