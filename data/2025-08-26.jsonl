We then go on\nto study the long-time behavior of hot spots on infinite cones over closed\nRiemannian manifolds.

The two phases occupy domains of the same\nspatial dimension, separated by a moving interface defined by the trace of the\nporoelastic displacement, which exhibits low regularity and strong geometric\nnonlinearities. Despite its importance in applications, no existence theory has\nbeen available for this nonlinear moving-domain setting, primarily because the\nlack of interface regularity precludes even the formulation of a weak solution\nframework.\n  To address this gap, we (1) introduce a regularization of the Biot\ndisplacement via spatial convolution at scale $\\delta > 0$, which defines\nregularized moving domains and interface, and (2) modify the weak formulation\nin a way that preserves energy consistency with the original problem. For each\nfixed $\\delta > 0$, we prove existence of a weak solution to the resulting\nregularized interface problem. The proof strategy involves inserting a thin\nplate of thickness $h > 0$ at the interface, applying a time-discretization via\na Lie operator splitting scheme, establishing uniform a priori bounds, and\nemploying Aubin-Lions compactness on moving domains. The analysis is\nparticularly involved, partly because the thin plate allows displacements in\nall spatial directions. Passing to the limit $h \\to 0$ with uniform-in-h\nestimates and compactness arguments yields a regularized interface weak\nsolution. The regularization introduced in this manuscript is essential to\nmaintain uniform geometric control of the moving interface and to accommodate\nvector-valued structural displacements."}
