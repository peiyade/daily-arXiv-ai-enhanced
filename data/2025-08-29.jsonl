The\ndistinguishing trait of the model is the choice of a nonlinear $(s,p)$ Riesz\npotential for describing the overall aggregation effect. We investigate radial\nstationary states of the dynamics, showing their relation with extremals of\nsuitable Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities. In the case that aggregation\ndoes not dominate over diffusion, radial stationary states also relate to\nglobal minimizers of a homogeneous free energy functional featuring the $(s,p)$\nenergy associated to the nonlinear potential. In the limit as the fractional\nparameter $s$ tends to zero, the nonlocal interaction term becomes a backward\ndiffusion and we describe the asymptotic behavior of the stationary states."}

Assuming a periodic distribution of perforations, we\ninvestigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the equations describing\nthe thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the material as the period\nof the microstructure tends to zero. The microscopic model is a phase-field\nmodel within the Ginzburg-Landau framework for second-order phase transitions,\nwhere the phase-field is directly related to the magnetization vector. This\nmodel couples a nonlinear equation for the magnetization with the quasi-static\nMaxwell system and another nonlinear equation for the temperature. The primary\nmathematical challenge lies in homogenizing these equations, which exhibit a\ncomplex doubly non-linear structure. Additionally, the extension operators used\nwithin the homogenization framework precludes the application of standard\nAubin--Lions compactness arguments. Our analysis employs two-scale convergence\nin conjunction with a two-scale decomposition based on an appropriate dilation\noperator. The nonlinearities are primarily addressed by means of a variant of\ncompensated compactness and a Vitali compactness argument. From the perspective\nof practical applications, this work enables the explicit calculation of a\nCurie temperature tensor, capturing at the macroscopic scale the coupled effect\nof the material's geometric structure and its magnetic permeability tensor."}
