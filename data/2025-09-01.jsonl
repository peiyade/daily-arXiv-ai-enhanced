Cabr\\'e and J.-M. Roquejoffre, 2013, ref.[8]) to the setting of\nmixed diffusion, which involves both the classical and the fractional Laplacian\nin order to analyze the long-time dynamics of the equation. A key step in our\napproach involves the construction and detailed study of the heat kernel\nassociated with the mixed operator, which we use to develop a theory of mild\nsolutions and establish a comparison principle in suitable weighted function\nspaces.\n  This framework allows us to rigorously establish the non-existence of\ntraveling waves and characterize the large-time spreading rate of solutions. We\nshow that the influence of the fractional Laplacian dominates over the\nclassical Laplacian, especially in the initial layer, where it dictates the\nexponential propagation rate and the thickness of the solution tails."}

For this, we\nconsider a system of coupled Swift--Hohenberg equations with dispersive terms\nand general, smooth nonlinearities. Close to the onset of instability, we\nderive a system of two coupled complex Ginzburg--Landau equations with a\nsingular advection term as amplitude equations and justify the approximation by\nproviding error estimates. We then construct space-time periodic solutions to\nthe amplitude equations, as well as fast-travelling front solutions, which\nconnect different space-time periodic states. This yields the existence of\nsolutions to the pattern-forming system on a finite, but long time interval,\nwhich model the spatial transition between different patterns. The construction\nis based on geometric singular perturbation theory exploiting the fast\ntravelling speed of the fronts. Finally, we construct global, spatially\nperiodic solutions to the pattern-forming system by using centre manifold\nreduction, normal form theory and a variant of singular perturbation theory to\nhandle fast oscillatory higher-order terms."}

While this\nproblem has been resolved for finite-dimensional systems fifty years ago, good\nconditions for infinite-dimensional systems remain a challenge, especially for\nsystems in spatial dimension larger than one. Our main result establishes\noptimal conditions for the existence of an $F$-equivalence pair $(T,K)$ for a\ngiven parabolic control system $(A,B)$. We introduce an extended framework for\n$F$-equivalence of parabolic operators, addressing key limitations of existing\napproaches, and we prove that the pair $(T,K)$ is unique if and only if $(A,B)$\nis approximately controllable. As a consequence, this provides a method to\nconstruct feedback operators for the rapid stabilization of semilinear\nparabolic systems, possibly multi-dimensional in space. We provide several\nillustrative examples, including the rapid stabilization of the heat equation,\nthe Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the Navier-Stokes equations and the\nquasilinear heat equation."}
