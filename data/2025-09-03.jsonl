This work is divided into two parts. First, we examine the\nNordstroem equation with a source term generated by an irrotational fluid\ngoverned by a linear equation of state. In the second part, we analyze the full\ncoupled system. One reason for this separation is that an irrotational fluid\nwith a linear equation of state introduces a source term for the Nordstroem\nequation containing a nonlinear term of fractional order. This nonlinearity\nprecludes the direct application of the techniques used in our earlier work\n\\cite{Brauer_Karp_23}, where we relied on symmetric hyperbolic systems, energy\nestimates, and homogeneous Sobolev spaces.
