The first problem\nconcerns a semidiscrete inverse source problem, which involves determining the\nrandom source term of the white noise in the stochastic parabolic equation\nusing observation data of the solution at the terminal time and the trace of\nthe discrete spatial derivative of the solution on a subdomain at the boundary\nof the space. The second problem addresses a semidiscrete Cauchy inverse\nproblem, which involves determining the solution of the stochastic parabolic\nequation in a subdomain of space-time, from the data of the solution and the\ntrace of the discrete spatial derivative on a subdomain of the boundary of\nspace and time. To address these problems, we establish two Carleman estimates\nfor a semidiscrete stochastic parabolic operator in arbitrary dimensions: one\nfor the homogeneous boundary condition and the other for the nonhomogeneous\nboundary condition. Applying these Carleman estimates, we obtain Lipschitz and\nH\\\"older stability for the first and second inverse problems, respectively."}

The main challenge arises from the fact that the\neigenfunctions of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem do not form an orthogonal\nsystem, due to the presence of a fractional derivative in space. To address\nthis difficulty, we introduce a bi-orthogonal basis for the Mittag-Leffler\nfunctions and use it to establish uniqueness and H\\\"older-type stability\nresults, provided the measurement time is sufficiently large. A Tikhonov\nregularization method is then employed to numerically solve the inverse source\nproblem. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy\nand efficiency of the proposed method and to validate our theoretical findings."}
