By duality, we simultaneously obtain integral representation\nformulas (i.e., left-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for overdetermined\nPDEs $P^{\\ast} v = g$ with analogous properties, which lead to Poincar\\'e- or\nKorn-type inequalities. Our method applies to operators such as the divergence,\nlinearized scalar curvature, and linearized Einstein constraint operators\n(which are underdetermined), as well as the gradient, Hessian, trace-free part\nof the Hessian, Killing, and conformal Killing operators (which are\noverdetermined).\n  The starting point for our construction is a condition - dubbed the recovery\non curves condition (RC) - that leads to Green's functions for $P$ supported on\nprescribed curves. Then the desired integral solution operators (and, by\nduality, integral representation formulas) are obtained by taking smooth\naverages over a suitable family of curves. This procedure generalizes the\nprevious constructions of Bogovskii, Oh-Tataru, and Reshetnyak. We furthermore\nidentify a simple algebraic sufficient condition for (RC), namely, that the\nprincipal symbol $p(x, \\xi)$ of $P$ is full-rank for all non-zero complex\nvectors $\\xi$ (as opposed to real, as in ellipticity). When the principal\nsymbol has constant coefficients, this is equivalent to (RC) and also to the\ncondition that the formal cokernel of $P$ (without any boundary conditions) is\nfinite-dimensional; for this reason, we call it the finite-dimensional cokernel\ncondition (FC). We give a short proof that all operators above satisfy (FC),\nand thus (RC).\n  Various applications will be considered in subsequent papers."}

The system\ndescribes the coexistence and interaction of water reservoirs, vegetation, and\nbushfire activity in a given ecosystem.\n  We perform a detailed stability analysis to determine the parameter space\nwhere an unstable homogeneous equilibrium becomes stable with respect to\nspatially nonuniform perturbations.\n  We also use diffusion to generate traveling trains in the form of periodic\norbits of the linearized system. These orbits are remnants of an unstable\nequilibrium in the absence of diffusion and arise from a nonsingular eigenvalue\ncrossing of the imaginary axis, while a third eigenvalue remains real and\nnegative, thereby ensuring linear stability for monocromatic waves.\n  These phenomena differ from ``classical'' Turing and Hopf bifurcations, as\nthe model does not involve distinct ``activators'' and ``inhibitors'', and the\neffects observed are not the byproduct of diffusion with necessarily differing\nspeeds. Also, differently from the classical Turing pattern, the role of\ndiffusion in this context is to stabilize, rather than destabilize, homogeneous\nequilibria.\n  We also consider the case of plant competition, showing a suitable form of\nTuring instability for slow-frequency oscillations in a small rainfall regime."}

The\nsystem models attraction-repulsion chemotaxis--an advanced mathematical biology\nframework for studying sophisticated cellular processes--yet despite its\nsignificant practical importance, the corresponding inverse problem has never\nbeen investigated, representing a true frontier in the field. The mixed-type\nnature of this system introduces significant theoretical difficulties that\nrender conventional methodologies inadequate, demanding fundamental extensions\nbeyond existing techniques developed for simpler, purely parabolic models.\nTechnically, the problem presents formidable obstacles: the coupling between\nparabolic and elliptic components creates inherent analytical complications,\nwhile the nonlinear structure resists standard approaches. From an applied\nperspective, the biological relevance adds another layer of complexity, as\nsolutions must maintain physical interpretability through non-negativity\nconstraints. Our work provides a complete theoretical framework for this\nchallenging problem, establishing rigorous unique identifiability results that\ncreate a one-to-one correspondence between boundary data and the model's\nparameters.
