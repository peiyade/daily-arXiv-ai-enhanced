The present paper focuses on the global solvability and\nboundedness of weak solutions. For general bounded initial data, which may be\nnon-integrable, we prove the existence of global weak solutions that remain\nuniformly bounded for all times. The proof relies on deriving local $L^p$\nestimates that are uniform in time via a new continuity-type argument and\nobtaining $L^\\infty$ bounds using Moser's iteration; all of these estimates are\nuniform as $\\eps\\to0$.

In many known\nexamples, it even leads to improved solution theory, a phenomenon known as\n\\emph{regularization by noise}. A common thread in the recent literature on the\ntopic is the so-called \\emph{It\\^o-Stratonovich diffusion limit}. By selecting\nStratonovich transport noise with carefully arranged vector fields, one can\nshow that the solution of certain SPDEs are close, in an appropriate topology,\nto an effective, deterministic, equation with a new effective second order\nelliptic operator, linked to the Ito-Stratonovich corrector.

A}, 380(2219)], we consider a transport noise made by a sum of independent\nand compactly supported vector fields. This setting is relevant for models of\nstratified turbulence which naturally occur in boundary layers and Boussinesq\nmodels. Due to the anisotropic nature of the noise, the identification of the\nlimit equation is not straightforward as in all other examples known in\nliterature, as the Ito-Stratonovich corrector is a generic second order\nelliptic operator with non-constant coefficients. Using tools from\nHomogenisation theory, we obtain a representation for the limiting effective\ndiffusivity matrix. Exploiting this representation, we study asymptotics, in\nthe $\\kappa \\rightarrow 0$ regime, of the effective diffusivity across a number\nof vector field regimes parametrised by the radius of their support. Finally,\nwe provide a careful numerical analysis of the effective diffusivity,\ndiscovering a nonlinear behavior for $\\kappa \\rightarrow 0$, in some regimes."}
