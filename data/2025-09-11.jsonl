We study the stabilities of the\nself-similar fan-shock-fan and shock-fan-shock composite waves constructed by\nVimercati et al. in that paper. %In order to study the stabilities of the\ncomposite waves, we solve some classes of shock free boundary problems. In\ncontrast to ideal gases, the flow downstream (or upstream) of a shock of a BZT\nfluid may possibly be sonic in the sense of the flow velocity relative to the\nshock front. In order to study the stabilities of the composite waves, we\nestablish some a priori estimates about the type of the shocks and solve some\nclasses of sonic shock free boundary problems. We find that the sonic shocks\nare envelopes of one out of the two families of wave characteristics, and not\ncharacteristics. This results in a fact that the flow downstream (or upstream)\na sonic shock is not $C^1$ smooth up to the shock boundary. We use a\ncharacteristic decomposition method and a hodograph transformation method to\novercome the difficulty cased by the singularity on sonic shocks, and derive\nseveral groups of structural conditions to establish the existence of curved\nsonic shocks."}

Although it has\nbeen extensively studied by many authors, we would like to return to a number\nof fundamental questions and known results, such as the traces and the maximal\nregularity of solutions. First, to treat non-homogeneous boundary conditions,\nwe rigorously define the notion of traces for non regular functions. This\napproach replaces the non-tangential trace notion that has dominated the\nliterature since the 1980s. We identify a functional space E = \\{v\\in\nH^{1/2}(\\Omega);\\nabla v\\in [H^1/2(\\Omega)]'\\} for which the trace operator is\ncontinuous from $E$ into $L^2(\\Gamma)$. Second, we address the regularity of\nsolutions to the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. Using\nspecific equivalent norms in fractional Sobolev spaces and Grisvard's results\nfor polygons and polyhedral domains, we prove that maximal regularity $H^{3/2}$\nholds in any BLD $\\Omega$, for all right-hand sides in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$. This conclusion contradicts the prevailing claims in\nthe literature since the 1990s. Third, we describe some criteria which\nestablish new uniqueness results for harmonic functions in Lipschitz domains.\nIn particular, we show that if $u\\in H^{1/2}(\\Omega)$ or $u\\in W^{1,\n2N/(N+1)}(\\Omega)$, is harmonic in $\\Omega$ and vanishes on $\\Gamma$, then $u=\n0$. These criteria play a central role in deriving regularity properties.\nFinally, we revisit the classical Area Integral Estimate. Using Grisvard's work\nand an explicit function given by Necas, we show that this inequality cannot\nhold in its stated form. Since this estimate has been widely used to argue that\n$H^{3/2}$-regularity is unattainable for data in the dual of\n$H^{1/2}_{00}(\\Omega)$, our counterexample provides a decisive clarification."}
