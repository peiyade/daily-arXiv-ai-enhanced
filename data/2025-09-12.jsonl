The CBFeD model describes the behavior of\nincompressible viscous fluid flow through a porous medium, incorporating the\neffects of convection, damping, and nonlinear resistance. The mathematical\nframework captures steady-state flow conditions under a no-slip boundary\nassumption, with a non-monotone boundary condition that links the total fluid\npressure and the velocity's normal component through a Clarke subdifferential\nformulation. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce an auxiliary\nhemivariational inequality resembling a nonlinear Stokes-type problem with\ndamping and pumping terms, which serves as a foundational tool in establishing\nthe existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the CBFeD model. The\nanalytical strategy integrates techniques from convex minimization theory with\nfixed-point methods, specifically employing either the Banach contraction\nmapping principle or Schauder's fixed point theorem. The Banach-based approach,\nin particular, leads to a practical iterative algorithm that solves the\noriginal nonlinear hemivariational inequality by sequentially solving\nStokes-type problems, ensuring convergence of the solution sequence.\nAdditionally, we derive equivalent variational formulations in terms of\nminimization problems. These formulations lay the groundwork for the design of\nefficient and stable numerical schemes tailored to simulate flows governed by\nthe CBFeD model."}
