The proof combines three key elements: (1) reduction\nfrom magnetic to Riemannian systems, (2) analysis of reparameterized flows, and\n(3) regularization techniques. Compared to previous analytic approaches, our\ngeometric method provides clearer insights into the underlying Riemannian\nstructure. We also establish necessary conditions for singularity existence,\nparticularly when the Euler characteristic is nonzero and the magnetic form is\nnon-exact.

This phenomenon occurs when solutions to governing\nequations, such as the 3D Euler equations, develop infinite gradients from\nsmooth initial conditions. Historically, numerical approaches have primarily\nidentified stable singularities. However, these are not expected to exist for\nkey open problems, such as the boundary-free Euler and Navier-Stokes cases,\nwhere unstable singularities are hypothesized to play a crucial role. Here, we\npresent the first systematic discovery of new families of unstable\nsingularities. A stable singularity is a robust outcome, forming even if the\ninitial state is slightly perturbed. In contrast, unstable singularities are\nexceptionally elusive; they require initial conditions tuned with infinite\nprecision, being in a state of instability whereby infinitesimal perturbations\nimmediately divert the solution from its blow-up trajectory. In particular, we\npresent multiple new, unstable self-similar solutions for the incompressible\nporous media equation and the 3D Euler equation with boundary, revealing a\nsimple empirical asymptotic formula relating the blow-up rate to the order of\ninstability. Our approach combines curated machine learning architectures and\ntraining schemes with a high-precision Gauss-Newton optimizer, achieving\naccuracies that significantly surpass previous work across all discovered\nsolutions.
