In this case the domain winds around a\nfixed circle infinitely many times and converges to it when the rotating angle\ngoes to infinity. For the homogeneous equation and the homogeneous Dirichlet\nboundary condition, in the case of bounded drifts, we prove that the maximum of\nthe solution on the cross-section corresponding to a given rotating angle\neither grows or decays exponentially as the angle goes to infinity. Results for\nthe oscillation and its asymptotic estimates are also obtained for\ninhomogeneous Dirichlet data. If the drift is unbounded but does not grow to\ninfinity too fast, then the above maximum also goes to either zero or infinity.\nFor the inhomogeneous equation, we obtain the estimates in the case of bounded\nforcing functions. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of the solution and\nits continuous dependence on the boundary data and the forcing function."}
