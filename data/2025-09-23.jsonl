The transition from nanoscale physics, that dictates their stable\nconfigurations, to macroscopic engineering applications requires the use of\nmultiscale methods to systematically capture their electronic properties at\nlarger scales. A key challenge in coarse-graining is the rapid and\nnear-periodic variation of the charge density, which exhibits significant\nspatial oscillations at the atomic scale. Therefore, the polarization density\nfield -- the first moment of the charge density over the periodic unit cell --\nis used as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. Unlike the highly\noscillatory charge density, the polarization varies over lengthscales that are\nmuch larger than the atomic, making it suitable for continuum modeling.\n  In this paper, we investigate the electrostatic potential arising from the\ncharge distribution of 2D materials. Specifically, we consider a sequence of\nproblems wherein the underlying lattice spacing vanishes and thus obtain the\ncontinuum limit. We consider 3 distinct limits: where the thickness is much\nsmaller than, comparable to, and much larger than the in-plane lattice spacing.\nThese limiting procedures provide the homogenized potential expressed in terms\nof the boundary charge and dipole distribution, subject to the appropriate\nboundary conditions that are also obtained through the limit process.

In 2D, an important physical effect associated with this system is the\nfamous Kutta-Joukowski effect. In the present paper, we identify a similar\neffect in the 3D case. For this, we first recast the Newtonian dynamics of the\nrigid body as a first-order nonlinear ODE for the $6$-component body velocity,\nin the body frame. Then, we focus on the particular case where the rigid body\noccupies a slender tubular domain with a smooth closed curve as the centerline\nand a circular cross-section, in the limit where the radius goes to zero, with\nfixed inertia and circulation around the curve. We establish that the dynamics\nof the limit massive rigid loop are given by a first-order nonlinear ODE with\ncoefficients that depend only on the inertia, on the fluid vorticity, and on\nthe limit curve through two $3$D vectors, which are involved in a skewsymmetric\n$6 \\times 6$ matrix that appears in the limit force and torque, a structure\nwhich is reminiscent of the 2D Kutta-Joukowski effect. We also identify the\nlimit fluid dynamics as, where, as in the case of the Euler equation alone, the\nvorticity evolves according to the usual transport equation with stretching,\nbut with a velocity field that is due not only to the fluid vorticity but also\nto a vorticity filament associated with the circulation around the limit rigid\nloop. This result is in stark contrast with the case where the filament is made\nof fluid, with non-zero circulation, since in the latter, the filament velocity\nbecomes infinite in the zero-radius limit.
