We prove the existence\nof a global-in-time weak solution, called the flat flow. A difficulty arises\nwhen we establish the local-in-time equi-boundedness of approximate solutions\nand a uniform $L^2$-estimate of multipliers. The difficulty is handled by\nconducting blowup analysis at a point in contact to a spherical cap with sharp\nangle."}

In recent papers by Ebert,Girardi,Reissig (Math. Ann.\n378 (2020)) and Girardi (Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. 32 (2025)), the authors\nobtained a sharp critical condition on $\\mu$ in low space dimensions $n=1,2,3$,\nwhich determines the threshold between global (in time) existence of small data\nsolutions and blow-up of solutions in finite time. Our new results are to prove\nthat this condition remains valid in dimension $n=4$, together with the\nasymptotic profiles of global solutions. From this, we see that the behavior of\nthe solution at $t \\to \\infty$ is identified by the Gauss kernel. Finally, a\nsharp lifespan estimate for local solutions is also derived in the case when\nblow-up occurs."}

The\nCahn-Hilliard equation includes a nonconservative source term accounting for\nmass exchange, and the velocity equation contains a non divergence-free forcing\nterm.
