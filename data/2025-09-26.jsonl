Specifically, we give decay criteria that ensures when a\nharmonic function for a positive quasilinear Schr\\\"odinger operator with\npotential less than 1 is trivially zero. The assumption of positivity of the\noperator allows the application of criticality theory such as the Liouville\ncomparison theorem. Furthermore, our results fundamentally build on the so\ncalled simplified energy. As an application we discuss the case of model graphs\nand in particular regular trees."}

Using the WKB\nreformulation, the backward equation of the rescaled process leads to a\ndiscrete Hamilton--Jacobi equation with state constraints. As the grid size\ntends to zero, the limiting solution and its associated variational\nrepresentation are closely connected to the good rate function of the large\ndeviation principle for state-constrained chemical reactions in the\nthermodynamic limit. In this work, we focus on the limiting behavior of\ndiscrete Hamilton--Jacobi equations defined on bounded domains with\nstate-constraint boundary conditions. For a single chemical reaction, we show\nthat, under a suitable reparametrization, the solution of the discrete\nHamilton--Jacobi equation converges to the solution of a continuous\nHamilton--Jacobi equation with a Neumann boundary condition.

Our focus lies on two-dimensional surfaces with fixed clamped boundary\nconditions, embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, and represented as\ngraphs of height functions over domains with non-smooth boundaries. Our\napproach involves constructing solutions through linearization and a\nfixed-point argument, requiring small boundary data in suitable functional\nspaces. Building on the results of Koch and Lamm \\cite{koch2012geometric}, we\nrewrite the Willmore equation for graphs in a divergence form that allows the\napplication of weighted second-order Sobolev spaces. This reformulation\nsignificantly weakens the regularity assumptions on both the boundary and the\nDirichlet data, reducing them to the $C^{1+\\alpha}$-class, while the solution\nremains smooth in the interior. Moreover, we extend the existence theory to\ndomains with merely Lipschitz boundaries within a purely weighted Sobolev\nframework. Our approach is also applicable to other higher-order geometric\nPDEs, including the graphical Helfrich and surface diffusion equations."}
