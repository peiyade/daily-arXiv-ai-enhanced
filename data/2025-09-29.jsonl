To solve this, we reformulate the inverse problem as a restricted\nminimization problem (RMP), aimed at optimizing a suitably regularized\nobjective functional. We use numerical techniques, specifically the iterative\nL-BFGS-B algorithm implemented in the Dolfin-Adjoint-Python-SciPy libraries, to\nsolve the RMP effectively. Following methodologies similar to those in Pipicano\net al., we establish a local stability result for the RMP. Additionally,\nthrough numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nidentification method in determining the linear velocity coefficient in\nBoussinesq-type systems."}

In the asymptotic profile of solutions, the\nnonlinearity of the equation is reflected. A characteristic component derived\nfrom nonlinearity develops logarithmically over time, and the rate of decay\nvaries depending on the spatial dimensions. The rate of this component\npredicted from the scale of the equation. In even dimensions, the logarithmic\ncomponent decays at the expected rate, but in odd dimensions, it decays much\nfaster than expected. These results suggest that there are differences in the\nsymmetry of nonlinearity depending on the parity of dimensions. This\ninterpretation is supported by comparison with similar Navier--Stokes\nequations. The Burgers type is applicable as an indicator for considering\nseveral bilinear problems."}
