A phase-field variable\nindicates the proportional distribution of the two fluids in the mixture. The\nmotion of the incompressible mixture is described in terms of the\nvolume-averaged velocity. Besides a volume-averaged Stokes-like viscous\ncontribution, the Cauchy stress tensor in the momentum balance contains an\nadditional volume-averaged internal stress tensor to model the elastoplastic\nbehavior. This internal stress has its own evolution law featuring the\nnonlinear Zaremba-Jaumann time-derivative and the subdifferential of a\nnon-smooth plastic potential. The well-posedness of this system is studied in\ntwo cases: Based on a regularization by stress-diffusion we obtain the\nexistence of Leray-Hopf-type weak solutions. In order to deduce existence\nresults also in the absence of the regularization, we introduce the concept of\ndissipative solutions, which is based on an estimate for the relative energy.\n  We discuss general properties of dissipative solutions and show their\nexistence for the viscoelastoplastic two-phase model in the setting of\nstress-diffusion.

This applies in particular to the operator obtained by\nlinearizing the equivariant Ginzburg-Landau equation on the hyperbolic plane\naround the degree one vortex. We systematically\n  construct the distorted Fourier transform by writing the Stone formula for\ncomplex energies and taking the limit as the energy tends to the spectrum of\nthe operator on the real line. This approach entails a careful analysis of the\nresolvent for complex energies in a neighborhood of the real line. It is the\nanalogue of the approaches used in \\cite{KS,ES2, LSS25}, where the limiting\noperator as $r\\to\\infty$ is not self-adjoint and which we carry out for all\nenergies. Our analysis serves as the starting point for the study of the\nstability of the Ginzburg-Landau vortex under equivariant perturbations."}
