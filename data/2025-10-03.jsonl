A key feature of this model is that the interior spike can\nundergo Hopf bifurcations in both amplitude and position, leading to rich\noscillatory dynamics not present in classical two-component systems. Using\nasymptotic analysis and numerical path-following, we construct localized spike\nequilibria and analyze spike nucleation that occurs through slow passage beyond\na saddle-node bifurcation. Moreover, stability of spike equilibrium is analyzed\nby introducing time-scaling parameters, which reveal two distinct mechanisms:\namplitude oscillations triggered by large-eigenvalue instabilities and\noscillatory spike motion associated with small eigenvalues. Numerical\nsimulations illustrate these dynamics and their transition regimes. This dual\nmechanism highlights richer spike behavior in three-component systems and\nsuggests several open problems for future study."}

This work\nadvances the study of its four-dimensional subalgebras, continuing the work\nstarted in Siraeva (2024). For a large subset of not previously considered,\nnon-similar four-dimensional subalgebras from an optimal list in Siraeva\n(2014), we compute a complete set of generating invariants. For one of the\nsubalgebras, we construct a partially symmetry-reduced system. We explicitly\nsolve this reduced system (submodel). This leads to new families of explicit\nsolutions of the original system. We analyze the trajectories of these\nsolutions.

Such estimates, however, have remained out of\nreach for more singular interactions. In this work, we develop a new framework\nbased on linearized correlation functions, which allows us to derive robust\nbounds for systems with merely square-integrable interaction kernels, providing\nthe first systematic control of correlations in the singular setting.

Since the\nsolutions we consider have opposite signs in the lower and upper half of the\ndomain, this is a quasilinear forward-backward parabolic problem, which changes\ntype across a critical curved line within the domain. In particular, lateral\nboundary conditions can be imposed only where the characteristics are inwards.\nThere are several difficulties associated with this problem. First, the\nforward-backward geometry depends on the solution itself. This requires to be\nquite careful with the approximation procedure used to construct solutions.\nSecond, and more importantly, the linearized equations solved at each step of\nthe iterative scheme admit a finite number of singular solutions, of which we\nprovide an explicit construction. This is similar to well-known phenomena in\nelliptic problems in nonsmooth domains. Hence, the solutions to the equation\nare regular if and only if the source terms satisfy a finite number of\northogonality conditions. A key difficulty of this work is to cope with these\northogonality conditions during the nonlinear fixed-point scheme. In\nparticular, we are led to prove their stability with respect to the underlying\nbase flow. To tackle this deceivingly simple problem, we develop a methodology\nwhich we believe to be both quite natural and adaptable to other situations in\nwhich one wishes to prove the existence of regular solutions to a nonlinear\nproblem for suitable data despite the existence of singular solutions at the\nlinear level.
