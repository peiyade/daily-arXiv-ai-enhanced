The\nsimplest representative is the Keyfitz-Kranzer system, where one equation is\nnonlinear and not coupled to the other, and the second equation is a linear\ntransport equation which coefficients depend on the solution of the first\nequation. In GARZ systems, the coupling is stronger, they do not have the\ntriangular structure of Keyfitz-Kranzer.\n  In our setting, we claim that it makes sense to address these systems via a\nkind of splitting approach. Indeed, [E. Y. Panov, Instability in models\nconnected with fluid flows II, 2008] proposes a robust framework for solving\nlinear transport equations with divergence free coefficients. Our idea is to\nuse this theory for the second equation of GARZ systems, and to exploit\ndiscontinuous flux theory advances for the first equation of the system."}

This results in a globally well-posed 3D\nequation which has exactly the same energy balance as the 3D NSE. Moreover, we\nshow in simulations that the system seems to exhibit chaotic dynamics. In the\nviscous case, we prove the global existence, uniqueness, and higher-order\nregularity of solutions to this equation with no restriction on the initial\ndata other than smoothness. In the inviscid case, local existence holds, but we\ngive an example of a class of solutions with smooth initial data that develop a\nsingularity in finite time in both 2D and 3D. Moreover, a new numerical\nalgorithm is presented in the 2D case, and simulations are included to\nillustrate the dynamics. In addition, a rotational-form modification for the 2D\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (KSE) is proposed, and global well-posedness is\nalso established. We also discuss several related ``rotational form''\nequations, and some pedagogical considerations.

The\nregularity holds provided the flow satisfies a mild structural assumption on\nits 1-dimensional slices taken orthogonal to the junction's $(k-1)$-dimensional\nspine, which prohibits certain topological degeneracies. We prove that this\nassumption is automatically satisfied by two fundamental classes of flows where\nsuch singularities are expected: codimension-one multi-phase flows, such as the\ncanonical $\\mathrm{BV}$-Brakke flows constructed by the authors, and flows of\narbitrary codimension with the structure of a mod 3 integral current, which\narise from Ilmanen's elliptic regularization.
