Our approach combines\nhigher-order linearization and the construction of complex geometrical optics\n(CGO) solutions. The main results establish that while unique recovery is not\nalways possible, we can precisely characterize the gauge equivalence classes in\nthe solutions to this inverse problem. For a wave equation with a polynomial\nnonlinearity of degree $n$, we prove that only the highest-order coefficient\ncan be uniquely determined from the DtN map; the lower-order coefficients and\nthe source can only be recovered up to a specific gauge transformation\ninvolving a function $\\psi$. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions\nunder which unique determination of all parameters is guaranteed. We also\nextend these results to various specific non-polynomial nonlinearities,\ndemonstrating that the nature of the nonlinearity critically influences whether\nunique recovery or a gauge symmetry is obtained."}
