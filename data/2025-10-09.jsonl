For sufficiently smooth, divergence-free u, we establish the a\npriori estimate without logarithmic loss $$\\|R_N(u)\\|{\\dot H^{-1}} \\lesssim\nN^{-1}\\,\\|u\\|{\\dot H^{1/2}}\\,\\|u\\|_{\\dot H^{1}},$$ with a constant independent\nof the dyadic frequency $N$. The proof combines phase-geometric integration by\nparts along an adapted frame, wave-packet discretization at scale $N^{-1/2}$,\nand an anisotropic Strichartz estimate on time windows of length $N^{-1/2}$. In\nthe wide angular region we apply bilinear decoupling on a rank-3 phase surface;\nin the geometry at hand the minimal curvature yields a gain of order\n$N^{-1/6+o(1)}$ (with $o(1)\\to 0$ as $N\\to\\infty$), which suffices to remove\nthe logarithmic loss. The contribution from the narrow region is handled\nseparately by an energy argument in $\\dot H^{-1}$ using null-form suppression\nnear the interaction diagonal. The resulting bound is scale-consistent and\nrequires no smallness assumptions, only the divergence-free condition on $u$.\nThe analysis is restricted to a single resonant component of the paraproduct;\npotential extensions are discussed."}

It is natural to ask,\nwhen the flow fattens, are there weak mean curvature flows supported strictly\ninside the fattening? Outside of some special cases (e.g. flow from cones),\nthis question was entirely open. We show these interior flows exist, providing\na general construction for non-outermost flows as limits of solutions to the\nparabolic $\\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn.
