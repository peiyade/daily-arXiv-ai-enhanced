We establish conditions for the\nglobal nonexistence of solutions to the problem under consideration, thereby\npartially improving some results of Filippucci and Ghergu in [Discrete Contin.\nDyn. Syst. A, 42 (2022) 1817-1833] and [Nonlinear Anal., 221 (2022) 112881]. In\naddition, we establish local and global existence results in the case where the\nconvolution term corresponds to the Riesz potential. Our methodology relies on\nthe nonlinear capacity method and the fixed-point principle, combined with the\nHardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality."}

Our main result shows that the minimizer is supported on two\nintervals when $1<b<2$, showing in particular how the support of the minimizer\ntransits from an interval (when $b=1$) to two points (when $b=2$) as $b$\nincreases. As a crucial part of the proof, we develop a new version of the\niterated balayage algorithm, the original version of which was designed by\nBenko, Damelin, Dragnev and Kuijlaars for logarithmic potentials in one\ndimension. We expect the methodology in this paper can be generalized to study\nminimizers of interaction energies in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ whose support is possibly\nan annulus."}

The setting involves a finitely\ngenerated abelian group $ \\mathtt{G}$ of rank $b$ acting on $M$ by isometries\nin a free, totally discontinuous, and co-compact manner, and a family of\nHamiltonians $H: T^*M \\times \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$, parametrized over a\nprobability space $(\\Omega, \\mathbb{P})$, which are stationary with respect to\na $\\mathbb{P}$-ergodic action of $\\mathtt{G}$ on $\\Omega$. Under standard\nassumptions, including strict convexity and coercivity in the momentum\nvariable, we prove that as the scaling parameter $\\varepsilon$ goes to $0$, the\nviscosity solutions to the rescaled equation converge almost surely and locally\nuniformly to the solution to a deterministic homogenized Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation posed on $\\mathbb{R}^b$, which corresponds to the asymptotic cone of\n$\\mathtt{G}$. In particular, this approach sheds light on the relation between\nthe limit problem, the limit space, and the complexity of the acting group. The\nclassical periodic case corresponds to a randomness set $\\Omega$ that reduces\nto a singleton; other interesting examples of this setting are also described.\n  We remark that the effective Hamiltonian $\\overline{H}$ is obtained as the\nconvex conjugate of an effective Lagrangian $\\overline{L}$, which generalizes\nMather's $\\beta$-function to the stochastic setting; this represents a first\nstep towards the development of a stationary-ergodic version of Aubry-Mather\ntheory. As a geometric application, we introduce a notion of stable-like norm\nfor stationary ergodic families of Riemannian metrics on $M$, which generalizes\nthe classical Federer-Gromov's stable norm for closed manifolds."}
