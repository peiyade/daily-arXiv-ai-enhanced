The classical Rayleigh-expansion\nradiation condition does not apply to our case, because this would require the\nmedium to be inhomogeneous in a half plane. We utilize the Floquet theory to\nderive upward/downward wave modes and define radiation conditions by expansions\nw.r.t. these modes. The downward radiation conditions leads to a downward\nDirichlet-to-Neumann map which can be used to truncate the infinite\ninhomogeneous domain in the vertical direction. So we prove mapping properties\nof the upward/downward Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps based on the asymptotic\nbehavior of high-order wave modes. Finally, we verify the strong ellipticity of\nthe sesquilinear form corresponding to the new scattering problem and show the\nunique solvability for all wavenumbers with the exception of a countable set of\nnumbers bounded below by a small positive constant."}

We establish quantitative\nconvergence in three settings. In one dimension with $(\\lambda,\\Lambda)$-convex\npotentials, i.e., potentials satisfying uniform lower and upper quadratic\nbounds, bounded communication weights yield exponential decay, while weakly\nsingular ones lead to sharp algebraic rates. For the Coulomb--quadratic\npotential $W(x)=-|x|+\\frac12 |x|^2$, we prove exponential convergence for\nbounded communication weights and algebraic upper bounds for singular\ncommunication weights. In a multi-dimensional setting with uniformly\n$(\\lambda,\\Lambda)$-convex potentials, we show exponential decay for bounded\nweights and improved algebraic decay for singular ones. In all cases, the\ndensity converges (up to translation) to the minimizer of the interaction\nenergy, while the velocity aligns to a uniform constant. A unifying feature is\nthat the convergence rate depends only on the local behavior of communication\nweights: bounded kernels yield exponential convergence, while weakly singular\nones produce algebraic rates. Our results thus provide a comprehensive\ndescription of the asymptotic behavior of Euler--alignment dynamics with\ngeneral interaction potentials."}

From an\necological perspective, the sign of the propagation speed determines the\nlong-term outcome of competition between two species and thus plays a central\nrole in predicting the success or failure of invasion of an alien species into\nhabitats occupied by a native species. Using comparison arguments, we establish\nsufficient conditions determining the sign of the propagation speed, which\nrefine previously known results. In particular, we show that in the symmetric\ncase, where the two species differ only in their diffusion rates, the faster\ndiffuser prevails over a substantially broader parameter range than previously\nestablished. Moreover, we demonstrate that when the interspecific competition\ncoefficients differ significantly, the outcome of competition cannot be\nreversed by adjusting diffusion or growth rates. These findings provide a\nrigorous theoretical framework for analyzing invasion dynamics, offering\nsharper mathematical criteria for invasion success or failure."}
