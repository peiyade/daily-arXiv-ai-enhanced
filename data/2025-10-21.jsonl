First, we establish a local well-posedness theory for the\nopen loop model in $L^2$-based fractional Sobolev spaces in the case of\nDirichlet-Neumann type inhomogeneous mixed boundary conditions. This local\nwell-posedness result is based on linear estimates derived by using the weak\nsolution formula obtained via the unified transform (also known as the Fokas\nmethod). Next, we study the global well-posedness properties of the open loop\nmodel in presence of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Then, we turn our\nattention to the rapid boundary feedback stabilization problem and design a\nnonlocal controller which uses a finite number of Fourier modes of the state of\nsolution. This design relies on the fact that solutions of the CGL equation can\nbe separated into a slow, finite-dimensional component and a rapidly decaying\ntail, with the former primarily governing long-term behavior. We determine the\nnecessary number of modes required to stabilize the system at a specified rate.\nAdditionally, we identify the minimum number of modes that ensure stabilization\nat an unspecified decay rate. These theoretical results are validated by\nnumerical simulations. The spatiotemporal estimates established in the first\npart of the paper are also employed to obtain local solutions of the controlled\nsystem. The existence of global energy solutions follows from stabilization\nestimates, while uniqueness follows from the uniqueness of an associated\ninitial-boundary value problem with homogeneous boundary conditions whose\nsolutions are in correspondence with the solutions of the original system\nthrough a bounded invertible Volterra-type integral transform on Sobolev\nspaces."}
