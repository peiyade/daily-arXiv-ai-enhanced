Our analysis is carried\nout in a non-variational setting, with no symmetry or structural assumptions on\nthe operator. The ellipticity and growth are prescribed via distinct Young\nfunctions, leading to a Orlicz-type setting that captures a wide class of\nnonstandard behaviors. As a special case, the theory encompasses and extends\nthe classical results on equations with $p,q$-growth."}

In this work, we show\nthat such highly contrasting transmissions create not only one resonance but a\nfamily of infinite resonances located near the real axis where the first one\n(i.e. the smallest) is indeed the Minnaert one. This family of resonances are\nthe shifts (in the lower complex plan) of the Neumann eigenvalues of the\nLaplacian. The well known Minneart resonance is nothing but the shift of the\ntrivial (zero) Neumann eigenvalue of the bubble. These resonances, other than\nthe Minnaert ones, are Fabry-P\\'erot-type resonances as the generated total\nfields, in the bubble, are dominated by a linear combination of the Neumann\neigenfunctions which, in particular, might create interferences. In addition,\nwe establish the following properties.\n  1. We derive the asymptotic expansions, at the second order, of this family\nof resonances in terms of the contrasting coefficient.\n  2. In the time-harmonic regime, we derive the resolvent estimates of the\nrelated Hamiltonian and the asymptotics of scattered fields that are uniform in\nthe whole space, highlighting the contributions from this sequence of\nresonances.\n  3. In the time domain regime, we derive the time behavior of the acoustic\nmicroresonator at large time-scales inversely proportional to powers of\nmicroresonator's radius.\n  4. The analysis shows that near Fabry-P\\'erot resonances, the mircoresonator\nexhibits pronounced anisotropy. We believe that such a feature may pave the way\nfor designing anisotropic metamaterials from simple configurations of a single\nmicroresonator."}

Such agglomeration provides a fundamental\nmechanism driving the spatial patterns of urbanization, labor migration,\nproductivity growth, and resource allocation. In this paper, we consider the\none-dimensional spatial Solow-Swan model with capital-induced labor migration,\nwhich captures the dynamic interaction between labor and capital through\nmigration and accumulation. Focusing on the regime of sufficiently small\ncapital diffusivity, we first construct an interior spike (spiky economic\nagglomeration) quasi-equilibrium. Next, we perform the linear stability of the\ncorresponding spike equilibrium by using a hybrid asymptotic and numerical\nmethod. We show that a single interior spike remains stable for small\nreaction-time constants but undergoes a Hopf bifurcation when the constant is\nsufficiently large, leading to oscillations in spike height (economic\nfluctuation). Finally, we derive a differential-algebraic system to capture the\nslow drift motion of quasi-equilibrium (core-periphery shift). Numerical\nsimulations are carried out to support our theoretical studies and reveal some\nintriguing yet unexplained dynamics."}

The scheme is based on a gradient flow approach\nwith discrete renormalization at each time step. The novelty of our scheme is\nthat the renormalization step deals at the same time with the mass and the\nmomentum constraints.
