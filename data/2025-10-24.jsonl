Our estimates are\nlocal in space and time, and independent of boundary conditions.\n  One of our main results is an abstract estimate that allows one to pass from\na local coercivity property to a global one using scaling, for a large class of\nequations. This allows us to reduce the problem of deriving a priori estimates\nto the case when $\\xi$ is small."}

Building upon the lower bound for\n$H_{c_1}$ and the characterization of the Meissner solution, we now establish a\nmatching upper bound for $H_{c_1}$, thereby identifying its leading-order\nbehavior. This result confirms the sharpness of the previously derived lower\nbound and further elucidates the connection between the onset of vorticity and\na weighted variant of the \\emph{isoflux problem}.

We pioneer classifications of\npotentially singular solutions, motivated by the issue of investigating the\nviability of numerical candidates.For approximately axisymmetric initial data,\nwe give the first quantitative classification of potentially singular solutions\nat \\textit{any} given time in the region of potential blow-up times. Moreover,\nthe quantitative bounds in the vicinity of any potential blow-up time are in\nprinciple amenable to numerical testing. To achieve this, we establish improved\nquantitative regions of regularity for approximately axisymmetric initial data,\nwhich may be of independent interest. Together with improved quantitative\nenergy estimates from \\cite{TB24}, this allows us to get a quantitative lower\nbound in the vicinity of a blow-up time by implementing the strategy of\n\\cite{BP21}, which is a physical space analogue of Tao's strategy \\cite{Ta21}\nfor producing quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions. To\nobtain a quantitative lower bound on the solution at any time in the region of\npotential blow-up times, we recursively apply quantitative Carleman inequality\narguments from \\cite{Ta21}. This necessitates careful bookkeeping to avoid\nexponential losses and to ensure that all forward-in-time iterations of\n(localized) vorticity concentration remain within the region of quantitative\nregularity of the solution."}

Classical\ntools to quantify the emergence of patterns, such as linear and weakly\nnonlinear analyses, pose significant mathematical challenges for these models\ndue to sharply peaked or singular steady states. Here, we present a weakly\nnonlinear framework that extends classical tools to structured PDE models in\nsettings where the base state is spatially uniform, but exponentially localized\nin the structured variable. Our approach utilizes WKBJ asymptotics and an\nanalysis of the Stokes phenomenon to systematically resolve the solution\nstructure in the limit where the steady state tends to a Dirac-delta function.\nTo demonstrate our method, we consider a chemically structured (nonlocal) model\nof motile bacteria that interact through quorum sensing. For this example, our\nanalysis yields an amplitude equation that governs the solution dynamics near a\nlinear instability, and predicts a pitchfork bifurcation. From the amplitude\nequation, we deduce an effective parameter grouping whose sign determines\nwhether the pitchfork bifurcation is subcritical or supercritical. Although we\ndemonstrate our framework for a specific example, our techniques are broadly\napplicable."}
