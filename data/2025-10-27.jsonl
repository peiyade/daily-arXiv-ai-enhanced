This new\nmodel of artificial neural networks exhibits strong memory and long-range\npath-dependence in learning processes. Through scaled group estimates it is\nproved that under rather general assumptions the solution dynamics is globally\ndissipative. The main result established a threshold condition for achieving\nrobust synchronization of the neural networks if it is satisfied by the\ninterneuron coupling strength coefficient. The synchronizing threshold is\nexplicitly computable in terms of the original parameters and strictly\ndecreasing for the fractional order $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$."}

This general formulation specifically addresses the significant case,\nwhere propulsion is generated by the oscillation of a mass located in an\ninternal cavity of the body. We provide a rigorous proof of the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for propulsion at the second order of magnitude of the\nforce. These conditions are implemented and confirmed by numerical tests for\nbodies without fore-and-aft symmetry, while they are silent for bodies with\nsuch symmetry, like round ellipsoids. Consequently, in this case, propulsion\ncan only occur at an order higher than the second. This problem is investigated\nby numerically integrating the entire set of equations, and the result shows\nthat, in fact, propulsion does occur, thus opening new avenues for further\nanalytical studies."}
