The methods developed in this\npaper offer new tools for addressing the generalized boundary rigidity problem\nand expand the scope of applications of double fibration transforms. We\nanticipate that these techniques will also be applicable to other geometric\ninverse problems. Beyond mathematics, our results have implications for the\nAdS/CFT correspondence in physics."}

We analyze the linear stability and\ninstability of small-amplitude, $2\\pi$-periodic Stokes wave solutions, under\nthe effect of longitudinal long-wave perturbations. The corresponding\nlinearized operator has periodic coefficients and a defective zero eigenvalue\nof multiplicity four. Using Bloch-Floquet theory, we investigate the associated\nfamily of periodic eigenvalue problems. For all surface tension values $\\kappa\n\\geq 0$ and depths $\\mathtt{h} > 0$, we establish the complete splitting of the\nfour eigenvalues near zero when both the wave amplitude and the Floquet\nparameter are small. Specifically, we rigorously prove that in the regions of\nunstable depth and capillarity identified formally by Djordjevic-Redekopp and\nAblowitz-Segur in the 1970's, the spectrum of the linearized operator near the\norigin depicts a \"figure 8\" pattern."}

This implies the\nGamma-convergence of the initial sum to either the classical perimeter or to\nthe $2s$-fractional perimeter, depending on whether $s \\ge 1/2$ or not.

The solution is unique among limits of smooth solutions and\ndepends continuously on the data. Our result applies to a richer class of\nquasi-periodic functions than previous theorems. Central to the argument is an\na-priori estimate, the proof of which utilizes Strichartz estimates for\nquasi-periodic functions obtained recently via decoupling, and a quasi-periodic\nextension of Tao's gauge transform. As a byproduct of our method, we also\nestablish new local wellposedness results in certain anisotropic Sobolev\nspaces."}
