We establish well-posedness and regularity of the law $\\rho_t$\nof the process through novel a priori estimates, and, very importantly, we\ncharacterize the large-time behavior of $\\rho_t$ under truly minimal\nassumptions on $\\mathcal{L}$. In the case of integrable Gibbs density, the law\nconverges to the normalized Gibbs measure. In the non-integrable case, we prove\nthat the law diffuses.

Under a\nPolyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on $\\mathcal{L}$, we also derive sharp\nexponential contractivity results toward the set of global minimizers.\nCombining these results we provide the first systematic convergence analysis of\nLangevin dynamics under PL conditions in non-integrable Gibbs settings: a first\nphase of exponential in time contraction toward the set of minimizers and then\na large-time exploration over it with rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$."}
