Despite\nthe importance, how time-periodic boundary conditions affect the long-time\nbehaviors of Riemann solutions has remained unclear. This work addresses this\ngap by rigorously proving that in both inviscid and viscous case, the\nasymptotic states of the solutions under the time-periodic boundary conditions\nare not only governed by the shifted background (viscous) shocks, but also\ncoupled with the time-periodic boundary solution induced by the time-periodic\nboundary. Our analysis reveals that these effects manifest as a propagating\n\"boundary wave\", which influences the shock dynamics."}

We establish the existence and\nuniqueness of the weak solution for the proposed equation. Several properties,\nincluding the equivalent forms of the weak solution and its asymptotic\nbehavior, are derived.
