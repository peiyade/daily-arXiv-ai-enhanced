We prove the existence of a statistically stationary solution in the\nclass of weak martingale entropy solutions for any adiabatic constant\n$\\gamma>1$, which satisfies an associated entropy inequality. To establish this\nresult, we use a multi-level approximation scheme consisting of a truncation\nparameter $R$ and an artificial viscosity parameter $\\epsilon$. The truncated\nsystem preserves the structure of the regularized system with the artificial\nviscosity, thereby providing key properties such as an invariant region and\nnon-existence of vacuum at the approximate level. These properties allow us to\nconstruct an invariant measure for the approximate system in both $R$ and\n$\\epsilon$ associated to a Feller semigroup for the well-posed dynamics of the\napproximate system for any $\\gamma > 1$. This gives us a statistically\nstationary solution for the approximate problem, which we then successively\npass to the limit as $R \\to \\infty$ and as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ to obtain a\nstatistically stationary solution to the original stochastic system. Our\nanalysis is novel, using new techniques for establishing uniform bounds on\nentropies of all orders, which allow us to pass to the limit in the parameters.\nWe believe that this result is a valuable step towards further understanding\nthe long-time statistical behavior of the stochastic Euler equations in one\nspatial dimension."}
