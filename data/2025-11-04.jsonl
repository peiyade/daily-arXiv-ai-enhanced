In the\nsecond layer, an additional more subtle mechanism is identified, potentially\ncapable of driving the scale of sparseness into the dissipation range and\npreventing the formation of a singularity.

The stem cells perform haptotaxis towards extracellular\nmatrix expressed by the chondrocytes and degraded by themselves. Cartilage\nproduction as part of the extracellular matrix is ensured by condrocytes. The\ngrowth factor is provided periodically, to maintain the cell dynamics.

Our results demonstrate how\nintegrated control strategies can effectively overcome the limitations\nidentified in previous studies. We prove two main results: (1) asymptotic\ncontrollability to single-species survival steady states under arbitrary system\nparameters, ensured by a combination of boundary and interior controls which\nact jointly to stabilize the system; and (2) finite-time controllability to a\nspecific heterogeneous coexistence steady state via a two-phase strategy -\nfirst steering the system near the target with boundary control, then\nactivating an interior multiplicative control in a localized region.
