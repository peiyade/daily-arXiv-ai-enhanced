I", "comment": null, "summary": "In order to avoid the electron oscillation of the cathode and enhance the\nwork efficiency of a vacuum diode, an approach for analyzing the solutions and\ncomplex bifurcation has been proposed and used to determine the optimal\ntrajectory of electron motion of the vacuum diode. This work is focusing on the\nstationary self-consistent problem of magnetic insulation in a\nspace-charge-limited vacuum diode, modeled by a singularly perturbed\n1.5-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell system. We focus on the insulated regime,\ncharacterized by the reflection of electrons back toward the cathode at a point\n$x^{*}.$ The analysis proceeds in two primary stages. First, the original\nVlasov-Maxwell system is reduced to a nonlinear singular system of ordinary\ndifferential equations governing the electric and magnetic field potentials.\nSubsequently, this system is further reduced to a novel nonlinear singular ODE\nfor an effective potential $\\theta(x).$ The existence of non-negative solutions\nto this final equation is established on the interval $[0, x^{*})$, where\n$\\theta(x)>0$. This is achieved by reformulating the associated initial value\nproblem into a system of coupled nonlinear Fredholm integral equations and\nproving the existence of fixed points for the corresponding operators. The most\nsignificant and previously unexplored case occurs when $\\theta(x)<0$ on the\ninterval $(x^{*}, 1]$, which corresponds to the fully insulated diode. For this\nregime, we present a novel numerical analysis of complex solution bifurcations,\nexamining their dependence on system parameters and boundary conditions.\nBifurcation diagrams illustrating the solution $\\theta(x)$ as a function of the\nfree boundary $x^{*}$ is constructed, and the insulated diode spacing is\ndetermined."}
