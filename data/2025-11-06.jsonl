This framework encompasses, as particular cases, mixed\nlocal and nonlocal operators such as $-\\Delta_p+(-\\Delta_p)^s$, finite\n(possibly infinite) sums of fractional $p$-Laplacians with different orders, as\nwell as operators involving fractional Laplacians with ``wrong\" signs.\n  The main findings, obtained through variational techniques, concern the\nspectral analysis of the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem associated with general\nsuperposition operators with special emphasis on various properties of the\nfirst eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenfunction.\n  We establish weak and strong maximum principles for positive superposition\noperators by introducing an appropriate notion of the {\\it nonlocal tail} for\nthis class of superposition operators and deriving a logarithmic estimate, both\nof which are of independent interest. Utilizing these newly developed tools, we\nfurther investigate the spectral properties of such superposition operators and\nprove that the first eigenvalue is isolated. Moreover, we show that the\neigenfunctions corresponding to positive eigenvalues are globally bounded and\nthat they change sign when associated with higher eigenvalues. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the second eigenvalue is well-defined and provide the mountain\npass characterization.\n  Finally, we address shape optimization problems, in particular, the\nFaber--Krahn inequality associated with the principal frequency associated with\nthe superposition operators."}
