These\nwaves represent traveling water waves propagating over sheared currents in a\nsemi-infinite cylinder, where the vorticity may exhibit discontinuities. The\nanalysis is carried out by applying a hodograph transformation, which\nreformulates the original free boundary problem into an abstract elliptic\nboundary value problem. Compared to previously studied steady water waves, the\npresent setting introduces several novel features: the presence of an internal\ninterface, an unbounded spatial domain, and a non-Fredholm linearized operator.\nTo address these difficulties, we introduce a height function formulation,\ncasting the problem as a transmission problem with suitable transmission\nconditions. A singular bifurcation approach is then employed, combining global\nbifurcation theory with Whyburns topological lemma. Along the global\nbifurcation branch, we show that the resulting wave profiles either attain\narbitrarily large wave speed or approach horizontal stagnation."}

Mamonov"], "title": "A variational Lippmann-Schwinger-type approach for the Helmholtz impedance problem on bounded domains", "comment": null, "summary": "Recently, reduced order modeling methods have been applied to solving inverse\nboundary value problems arising in frequency domain scattering theory. A key\nstep in projection-based reduced order model methods is the use of a\nsesquilinear form associated with the forward boundary value problem. However,\nin contrast to scattering problems posed in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, boundary value\nformulations lose certain structural properties, most notably the classical\nLippmann-Schwinger integral equation is no longer available. In this paper we\nderive a Lippmann-Schwinger type equation aimed at studying the solution of a\nHelmholtz boundary value problem with a variable refractive index and impedance\nboundary conditions. In particular, we start from the variational formulation\nof the boundary value problem and we obtain an equivalent operator equation\nwhich can be viewed as a bounded domain analogue of the classical\nLippmann-Schwinger equation. We first establish analytical properties of our\nvariational Lippmann-Schwinger type operator. Based on these results, we then\nshow that the parameter-to-state map, which maps a refractive index to the\ncorresponding wavefield, maps weakly convergent sequences to strongly\nconvergent ones when restricted to refractive indices in Lebesgue spaces with\nexponent greater than 2. Finally, we use the derived weak to strong sequential\ncontinuity to show existence of minimizers for a reduced order model based\noptimization methods aimed at solving the inverse boundary value problem as\nwell as for a conventional data misfit based waveform inversion method."}
