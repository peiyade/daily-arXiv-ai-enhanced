Subsequently, we derive the integral formula using the forcing operator method, previously applied to the Kawahara equation on the half-line by Cavalcante and Kwak (GAFA 1993), and the Fourier restriction method of Bourgain (NoDEA 2020). This work has the potential to be extended to other fifth-order nonlinear dispersive equations on star graphs."}

Compared to rates derived from the dissipation of the classical relative entropy, this approach yields improved estimates at early and intermediate times, and consequently a sharper convergence in the $L^1$-norm.

The coupling between these two distinct PDE dynamics occurs across a boundary interface, with each of the components evolving on its own distinct geometry, with the boundaries concerned being Lipschitz. For simplicity, we consider the linear version of this FSI system with Stokes flow.
