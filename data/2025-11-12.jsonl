The simplicity of our model allows us to succinctly illustrate various phenomena of geometric and analytic significance tied to shocks, which we view as a prototype for phenomena that can occur in more general quasilinear hyperbolic PDE solutions.\n  Our Cauchy problem admits a classical solution that blows up in finite time. The classical solution is defined in a largest possible globally hyperbolic region called a maximal globally hyperbolic development (MGHD), and its properties are tied to the intrinsic Lorentzian geometry of the equation and solution. The boundary of the MGHD contains an initial singularity, a singular boundary along which the solution's second derivatives blow up (the solution and its first derivatives remain bounded), and a Cauchy horizon. Our main results provide the first example of a provably unique MGHD for a shock-forming quasilinear wave equation solution; it is provably unique because its boundary has a favorable global structure that we precisely describe.\n  We also prove that for the same $C^{\\infty}$ initial data, the Cauchy problem admits a second kind of solution: a unique global weak entropy solution that has a shock curve separating two smooth regions. Of particular interest is our proof that the classical and weak solutions agree before the shock but differ in a region to the future of the first singularity where both solutions are defined."}

Special cases of the latter family of equations include the standard gKdV equation with a power nonlinearity, as well as weakly nonlinear perturbations of the KdV equation. The distance estimates are established for initial data and nonlinearity parameters of arbitrary size. A crucial step for their derivation is the proof of a size estimate for local solutions to the gKdV family of equations, which is linear in the norm of the initial data. As a result, the distance estimates themselves predict that the dynamics between the gKdV and KdV equations remains close over long times for initial amplitudes even close to unity, while for larger amplitudes they predict an explicit rate of deviation of the dynamics between the compared equations. These theoretical results are illustrated via numerical simulations in the case of one-soliton and two-soliton initial data, which are in an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Importantly, in the case of a power nonlinearity and large solitonic initial data, the deviation between the integrable and non-integrable dynamics can be drastically reduced upon incorporating suitable rotation effects by means of a rescaled KdV equation. As a result, the integrable dynamics stemming from the rescaled KdV equation may persist in the gKdV family of equations over remarkably long timescales."}

These are meant to be the analog of any of the following types of equations in the continuum setting of partial differential and nonlocal integro-differential equations: Hamilton-Jacobi (typically first order and local), Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann-Isaacs (first, second, or fractional order), and elliptic integro-differential equations (nonlocal equations). We give conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions of these equations, and work through a long list of examples in which these assumptions are satisfied. This work is meant to accomplish three goals: complement and unite earlier assumptions and arguments focused more on the Hamilton-Jacobi type structure; import ideas from nonlocal elliptic integro-differential equations; and argue that nearly all of the operators in this family enjoy a common structure of being a monotone function of the differences of the unknown, plus ``lower order'' terms. This last goal is tied to the fact that most of the examples in this family can be proven to have a Bellman-Isaacs representation as a min-max of linear operators with a graph Laplacian structure."}

We also clarify the relationship between the asymptotic analysis with respect to the parameter $α$ and the asymptotics of the system in connection with the convergence of convex functionals known as {M}osco convergence.

Under the assumptions of sufficiently small shock strength and initial perturbations, we prove that planar viscous shock waves are nonlinearly stable. The main steps of our analysis are as follows. First, using the relative entropy method together with the framework of $a$-contraction with shifts, we derive energy estimates for the weighted relative entropy of perturbations. We then successively obtain high-order and dissipation estimates via direct energy arguments, which provide the required a priori bounds. Combining these estimates with a local existence result, we establish the global asymptotic stability of the shifted planar viscous shock wave. Finally, we show that as the relaxation parameter tends to zero, solutions of the relaxed system converge globally in time to those of the classical Navier-Stokes system."}

We begin by establishing several a priori estimates that provide regularity results and describe the qualitative behavior of solutions. A critical threshold level for the parameter $λ$ is identified, which plays a crucial role in determining the existence or nonexistence of solutions. The sub and supersolution method is employed to obtain a weak solution. Furthermore, we establish a relation between the local minimizers of $\\mathcal{D}^{s,2}(\\mathbb{R}^N)$ versus $C(\\mathbb{R}^N; 1+|x|^{N-2s})$.

We improve upon the method for the construction of semi-analytical solutions for the oil displacement by a water slug containing dissolved chemicals given in (Pires, Bedrikovetsky and Shapiro, 2006) and later generalized in (Apolinário, de Paula and Pires, 2020), (Apolinário and Pires, 2021). This method utilizes a transformation into the Lagrange coordinates that splits the equations and allows one to solve the chromatographic one-phase problem separately. The solution is then substituted into a scalar hyperbolic conservation law, which is solved using the method of characteristics. However, there is often a gap in the characteristics near the chemical shock front. It was posited to the authors that the Jouguet principle could be used to close that gap. However, no rigorous justification was given for this approach, and as such it remained a heuristic. We analyze the conditions for the appearance of the gap and its properties, and give a proper argumentation for the Jouguet heuristic and its applicability based on the Kružkov-type uniqueness theorem for the conservation law system. Additionally, a second splitting technique within the Lagrange coordinates is developed that simplifies this analysis and the construction of characteristics.\n  Keywords: Enhanced oil recovery, Polymer flooding, Slug injection, Conservation laws, Hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations"}
