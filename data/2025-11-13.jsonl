Two asymptotic regimes in phase space are relevant to the non-relativistic limit: one corresponding to what physicists call ``natural'' units, in which the PDE is approximable by the free Klein--Gordon equation, and a low-frequency regime in which the equation is approximable by the usual Schrödinger equation. As shown in the companion paper, combining the analyses in the two regimes gives global estimates which are uniform as the speed of light goes to infinity. In this paper, we derive asymptotics from those estimates. Our framework differs from those in previous works in that ours is based on spacetime phase-space analysis."}

Our analysis relies on the construction of suitable upper and lower bounds, on the extension to a slightly bigger annulus and on the minimization of the mean-field energy appearing in the lower bound.

We treat the governing equations using a modification of the Zakharov-Craig-Sulem formulation for water waves, reducing the problem to a single nonlocal equation for the free-surface elevation variable $η$. The nonlocality in the equation takes the form of a Dirichlet-Neumann operator whose analyticity (in standard function spaces) is demonstrated by studying its defining boundary-value problem in newly introduced Sobolev spaces for radial functions.\\ Using rudimentary fixed-point arguments and Fourier analysis we rigorously reduce the equation for $η$ to a perturbation of a Korteweg-de Vries equation (for strong surface tension) or a nonlinear Schrödinger equation (for weak surface tension), both of which have nondegenerate explicit solitary-wave solutions. The existence theory is completed using an appropriate version of the implicit-function theorem."}

For such nonlinearities, we establish two main results. The first is the construction of a singular solution. Recently, Fujishima, Ioku, Ruf, and Terraneo [10] proved the existence of singular solutions under certain assumptions for nonlinearities. We succeed in relaxing these conditions by providing the precise asymptotic form of a singular solution. Our second result concerns the bifurcation diagram of regular solutions. While the bifurcation structure has been extensively studied in three or higher dimensions, comparatively little was known in two dimensions until recently. In [18], the second author proved that the bifurcation curve possesses infinitely many turning points for supercritical analytic nonlinearities. In the present work, we refine this analysis by showing the bifurcation curve oscillates infinitely many times around some point, without assuming analyticity of the nonlinearities. The novelty of our approach lies in the introduction of a generalized Emden-type transformation."}

Our model is the microcanonical binary-collision (MBC) process: a reversible pure-jump $N$-particle Markov process that is Landau-native, realizing the grazing-collision mechanism via small conservative rotations of relative velocities. The analysis hinges on two critical structural pillars: a Fisher-information dissipation mechanism that extends the Guillén--Silvestre paradigm (Acta Math. 234:315-375, 2025) to a genuinely conservative particle system, yielding robust control of singular configurations, and a quantitative self-averaging principle that enforces a coherent deterministic emergence of the Landau flow from the microscopic dynamics. We prove propagation of chaos in the joint mean-field and grazing-collision limit ($N\\to\\infty, h\\to 0$), identifying any limit point with the unique global solution to the Landau equation. Furthermore, we rigorously derive the Landau master equation as the grazing-collision limit of the MBC process.

To be more specific, we will be interested in the propagation of acoustic waves in guides which are unbounded in one direction. In general, the diffraction of an incident field in such a structure in presence of an obstacle generates a reflection and a transmission characterized by some scattering coefficients. Our goal will be to play with the geometry, the frequency and/or the index material to control these scattering coefficients. We will explain how to:\n  - develop a continuation method based on the use of shape derivatives to construct invisible defects;\n  - exploit complex resonances located closed to the real axis to hid obstacles;\n  - construct a non self-adjoint operator whose eigenvalues coincide with frequencies such that there are incident fields whose energy is completely transmitted.\n  Our approaches will mainly rely on techniques of asymptotic analysis as well as spectral theory for self-adjoint and non self-adjoint operators. Most of the results will be illustrated by numerical experiments."}

As a main novelty and different from previous results, we deal with the singular limit and therefore cover the true unregularized Hibler stress. To this end, we introduce an energy-based notion of solution that is able to capture plasticity effects of sea ice. This requires certain relaxations of the Hibler energies and, by the different function space set-up, comes with novel challenges. In particular, we establish a bulk approximation result of the boundary terms in the evolutionary relaxed Hibler energies. This is achieved by developing a novel reduction scheme for nonlinear trace expressions which should be of independent interest. Finally, based on our main results, we classify our findings within a broader concept of solutions that is applicable to the non-constant mass case too."}
