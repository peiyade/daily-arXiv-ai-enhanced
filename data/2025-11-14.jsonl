Motivated by the work of Cheng and Mahalov on fast rotating spheres and Xu on Rossby-Haurwitz solutions on ellipsoids, we adapt their framework to establish a parallel result for Euler flows on a rotating ellipsoidal surface. In the regime of rapid rotation, we prove that the time-averaged velocity field remains uniformly bounded in Sobolev norms independent of the rotation rate and converges to a longitude-independent zonal flow depending only on latitude. This shows that the zonalization phenomenon discovered by Cheng and Mahalov on the sphere persists on biaxial ellipsoids, thereby bridging the gap between spherical and ellipsoidal theories of fast rotating Euler dynamics."}

In the case of $m-$fold symmetry, the dependence on the angular momentum can be dropped. Using this, we affirm the results of prior simulations by demonstrating linear in time perimeter growth for a simply connected perturbation of the Rankine vortex."}

Pego"], "title": "Analysis of the adhesion model and the reconstruction problem in cosmology", "comment": "53 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "In cosmology, a basic explanation of the observed concentration of mass in singular structures is provided by the Zeldovich approximation, which takes the form of free-streaming flow for perturbations of a uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe in co-moving coordinates. The adhesion model suppresses multi-streaming by introducing viscosity. We study mass flow in this model by analysis of Lagrangian advection in the zero-viscosity limit. Under mild conditions, we show that a unique limiting Lagrangian semi-flow exists. Limiting particle paths stick together after collision and are characterized uniquely by a differential inclusion. The absolutely continuous part of the mass measure agrees with that of a Monge-Ampère measure arising by convexification of the free-streaming velocity potential. But the singular parts of these measures can differ when flows along singular structures merge, as shown by analysis of a 2D Riemann problem. The use of Monge-Ampère measures and optimal transport theory for the reconstruction of inverse Lagrangian maps in cosmology was introduced in work of Brenier & Frisch et al. (Month. Not. Roy. Ast. Soc. 346, 2003). In a neighborhood of merging singular structures in our examples, however, we show that reconstruction yielding a monotone Lagrangian map cannot be exact a.e., even off of the singularities themselves."}

As a byproduct of our method, we obtain explicit expressions for the maximizing functions and, in certain specific situations, we show that the associated constants are sharp. We emphasise that our approach unifies, generalises and improves several existing results in the literature."}

The main observation of the present work is the following: $W_0^{1,p}(Ω)$-solutions of the equation $-Δ_p u = μ|u|^{q-2}u + |u|^{r-2}u$ parameterized by $μ$ are in bijection with properly normalized critical points of the $0$-homogeneous Rayleigh type quotient $R_α(u)=\\|\\nabla u\\|_p^p/ (\\|u\\|_q^{αp} \\|u\\|_r^{p-αp})$ parameterized by $α$. We study this bijection and properties of $R_α$ for various relations between $p,q,r$. In particular, for the generalized convex-concave problem (the case $q<p<r$) the bijection allows to provide the existence and characterization of all degenerate solutions corresponding to the inflection point of the fibred energy functional: they are critical points of $R_α$ exclusively with $α= (r-p)/(r-q)$. In the subhomogeneous case $q<r \\leq p$ and under additional assumptions on $Ω$, the ground state level of $R_α$ is simple and isolated, and minimizers of $R_α$ exhaust the whole set of sign-constant solutions of the corresponding equation. In the superhomogeneous case $p < q<r$, there are no sign-changing critical points in a vicinity of the ground state level of $R_α$."}
