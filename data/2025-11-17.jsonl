Yapu"], "title": "Local controllability of free boundary three-dimensional semilinear radial parabolic equations", "comment": null, "summary": "We prove that a free boundary semilinear heat equation with Stefan boundary condition and radially symmetric data is locally null controllable. The strategy involves reducing the problem to the corresponding one-dimensional formulation and adapting a Carleman inequality in that setting. The local null controllability of the free-boundary problem is then established via the Schauder fixed-point theorem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first controllability result for this problem with Stefan boundary condition in more than one spatial dimension."}

We introduce a novel accelerated second-order scheme, leveraging the differential structure of the Wasserstein space in both Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. For sufficiently smooth energy functionals, we show that our scheme provably achieves an optimal quadratic convergence rate. Under the weaker assumptions of Wasserstein differentiability and $λ$-displacement convexity (for any $λ\\in \\mathbb{R}$), we show that our scheme still achieves a first-order convergence rate and has strong numerical stability. In particular, we show that the energy is nearly monotone in general, while when the energy is $L$-smooth and $λ$-displacement convex (with $λ>0$), we prove the energy is non-increasing and the norm of the Wasserstein gradient is exponentially decreasing along the iterates. Taken together, our work provides the first fully rigorous proof of accelerated second-order convergence rates for smooth functionals and shows that the scheme performs no worse than the classical scheme JKO scheme for functionals that are $λ$-displacement convex and Wasserstein differentiable."}

We study boundary data which are of staircase type and show rather general lower scaling bounds, both in the setting of prescribed Dirichlet data and for periodic configurations with a mean value constraint. In contrast to the setting without gauge invariances, these lower scaling bounds depend on \\emph{two} parameters -- the order of lamination of the boundary data as well as the number of involved (non-)degenerate symmetrized rank-one directions. By discussing upper bounds in specific geometries and for a specific constellation of wells, we give evidence of the sharpness of these lower bound estimates. Hence, it is necessary to keep track of the outlined \\emph{two} parameters in deducing scaling laws within the geometrically linearized theory of elasticity."}

In this paper, this problem is analyzed from the point of view of the existing mathematical theory of uniqueness classes for degenerate parabolic equations. For the special case of degeneracy, a new example is constructed demonstrating the accuracy of the uniqueness theorem for a solution in the class of functions with sublinear growth at infinity."}

This quantitative enhancement is proved in terms of the asymmetry of domain. The key role is played by a careful analysis of the propagation of asymmetry for the level sets of the solutions of a PDE. As a byproduct, we obtain an alternative proof of the quantitative Saint-Venant inequality for the Robin torsion and, in the planar case, of the quantitative Faber-Krahn inequality for the first Robin eigenvalue. In addition, we complete the framework of the rigidity result of the Talenti inequalities with Robin boundary conditions."}

The main application of the model refers to tumor progression, where the phase variable denotes the local proportion of active cancer cells and the chemical concentration may refer to a nutrient transported by the blood flow or to a drug administered to the patient. The resulting system is characterized by cross-diffusion effects similar to those appearing in the Keller-Segel model for chemotaxis; in particular, the nutrient tends to be attracted towards the regions where more active tumor cells are present (and consume it in a quickier way). Complementing various recent results on related models, we investigate here the long-time behavior of solutions under the perspective of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. To this aim, we first identify a regularity setting in which the system is well posed and generates a closed semigroup according to the terminology introduced by Pata and Zelik. Then, partly based on the approach introduced by Rocca and the first author for the Cahn-Hilliard system with singular potential, we prove that the semigroup is strongly dissipative and asymptotically compact so guaranteeing the existence of the global attractor in a suitable phase space. Finally, we discuss the sign properties of the nutrient and prove that, under additional assumptions on the initial data, its concentration is uniformly larger than some strictly positive constant at least on finite time intervals."}

In doing so, we investigate classes of symmetry and show that, for suitable symmetry configurations, there exists a non-trivial solution which changes sign and respects the corresponding prescribed symmetry. In addition, we describe conditions under which these symmetry-types are incompatible. Especially, we demonstrate the existence of entire nodal solutions for an infinite number of distinct symmetry types."}
