While the convergence of this PDE-based thickness to the geometric thickness had been rigorously justified only for simple geometries such as intervals and straight bands, its validity for more general shapes remained open. In this work, we extend the analysis to annular domains, where curvature effects are nontrivial. We prove that the PDE-based thickness converges to the geometric thickness as the diffusion parameter tends to zero by estimating the difference between two notions of thickness with the square root of the diffusion parameter. Explicit expressions involving modified Bessel functions are obtained for annuli, together with sharp inequalities for their ratios.

The Deift-Zhou steepest descent method is used to deform the associated $3 \\times 3$ Riemann-Hilbert problem to the Painlevé IV model. Then asymptotic formulas for the modified Boussinesq equation in both the Painlevé region and the Painlevé transition region are derived, characterized by the Clarkson-McLeod solution of the Painlevé IV equation. Additionally, the leading-order term of the good Boussinesq equation in Painlevé region is obtained via the Miura transformation. The theoretical asymptotic solutions are validated against direct numerical simulations, confirming the accuracy of the asymptotic analysis."}

By precisely characterizing the interaction between the degeneracy law of equations and the growth behavior of the Hamiltonian terms, we establish the Lipschitz regularity of viscosity solutions by the Ishii-Lions method, and further show the gradient Hölder continuity for solutions via utilizing perturbation techniques. Additionally, under minimal assumptions on the degeneracy pattern, the $C^1$-differentiability property of solutions is explored as well."}

This modulated energy was introduced by the third author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where this control is an essential ingredient. Previous work of the last two authors and Q.H. Nguyen arXiv:2107.02592 showed a similar functional inequality but with an additive $N$-dependent error (where $N$ is the number of particles, $\\mathsf{d}$ the dimension, and $\\mathsf{s}$ the inverse power of the Riesz potential) which was not sharp. In this paper, we obtain the optimal $N^{\\frac{\\mathsf{s}}{\\mathsf{d}}-1}$ error, for all cases, including the sub-Coulomb case. Our method is conceptually simple and, like previous work, relies on the observation that the derivative along a transport of the modulated energy is the quadratic form of a commutator. Through a new potential truncation scheme based on a wavelet-type representation of the Riesz potential to handle its singularity, the proof reduces to averaging over a family of Kato-Ponce type estimates.\n  The commutator estimate has applications to sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases both at and out of thermal equilibrium. In particular, we show here for $\\mathsf{s}<\\mathsf{d}-2$ the expected $N^{\\frac{\\mathsf{s}}{\\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows. This complements the recent work arXiv:2407.15650 on the optimal rate for the (super-)Coulomb case $\\mathsf{d}-2\\le \\mathsf{s}<\\mathsf{d}$ and therefore resolves the entire potential Riesz case."}

The non-null model violates the null condition and typically develops finite-time blow-up; the null-form model is Lorentz-invariant and enjoys small-data global existence, yet still admits blow-up for large data. Building on our earlier work on spatial-derivative nonlinearities, we construct and classify a five-parameter family of generalized self-similar blow-up solutions that captures the observed dynamics. We prove that no smooth exact self-similar profiles exist, while the generalized self-similar solutions -exhibiting logarithmic growth- provide the correct blow-up description inside backward light cones. We further establish asymptotic stability for the relevant branches, including the ODE-type blow-up in both models. These results yield a coherent and unified picture of blow-up mechanisms in time-derivative nonlinear wave equations."}
