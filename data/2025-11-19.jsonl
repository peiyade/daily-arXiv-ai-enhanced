Under the geometric control condition on the damping and an assumption on the set of stationary solutions, we establish a sharp trichotomy for initial data with energy slightly above that of the ground state: every solution either blows up in finite time, decays exponentially to zero, or converges to a ground state. We provide a complete classification of the Duffing dynamics above the energy of the constant solution, use it to construct Klein-Gordon solutions realising each of the three behaviours, and derive a simple spectral criterion ensuring that the ground states are nonconstant--and hence that the solutions realising the three regimes lie above the ground-state energy."}

The nonlocal nature of the fractional derivative presents significant analytical challenges, making classical methods such as the Faedo-Galerkin approach inadequate in their standard form for a full analysis of the problem. To address these difficulties, we develop and rigorously analyze new functional spaces specifically designed for the fractional setting. These spaces allow us to reformulate weak solutions in a manner consistent with the fractional dynamics, thereby enabling the successful implementation of a generalized Galerkin scheme. Our formulation not only extends the classical theory but also provides a foundation for the study of broader classes of fractional partial differential equations in fluid mechanics and related areas."}

The model incorporates root infection and mortality rates as functions of root age, providing a more realistic representation of the infection dynamics. We prove that the model is well-defined by establishing the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution using the theory of semi-groups for nonlinear evolutionary systems. We further show that the solution is positive and bounded. Under additional assumptions on the regularity of the parameters and the data, we prove that the mild solution is indeed a classical solution. We then study the asymptotic behaviour of the solution by deriving a threshold parameter \\(\\mathcal{N}\\), which determines the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the proposed model using the semi-implicit Euler method. The biological consistency of the numerical solutions is established, and simulations are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results and estimate yield losses caused by nematodes. We conclude the numerical analysis by implementing an impulsive control strategy, which confirms that the use of nematicides - whether chemical or biological - helps to mitigate the devastating effects of nematodes and enhances crop yield."}

At the macroscopic level, the system recovers a Lotka-Volterra model and defines an explicit family of equilibrium densities that depend on the form of the diffusion coefficient. By introducing Energy-type distances, we rigorously establish exponential convergence to equilibrium in appropriate homogeneous Sobolev spaces, with a rate explicitly determined by the dissipative contribution of the interaction term. The analysis highlights the intrinsic energy dissipation mechanism governing the dynamics and clarifies how the evolution of expected quantities determines the emergence of a stable equilibrium configuration. This approach provides a new perspective on the convergence to equilibrium for problems with time-dependent coefficients."}

This gradient flow appears formally as the limit of the minimizing movement scheme, a.k.a. JKO scheme, when the squared Wasserstein distance is substituted by the Sinkhorn divergence. We prove well-posedness and stability of the flow, and that, in the long term, the energy always converges to its minimal value. The analysis is based on a change of variable to study the flow in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, in which the evolution is no longer a gradient flow but described by a monotone operator. Under a restrictive assumption we prove the convergence of our modified JKO scheme towards this flow as the time step vanishes. We also provide numerical illustrations of the intriguing properties of this newly defined gradient flow."}

Couette flow induces mixing and generates magnetic induction, while the constant magnetic field stabilizes $z$-dependent modes. In contrast, the $z$-averaged magnetic field exhibits algebraic growth. Letting $μ$ denote the inverse fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers, we analyze how $μ$ governs stability thresholds in Sobolev spaces.\n  We identify a nonlinear transient-growth regime characterized by the sharp threshold $5/6\\le γ\\le 1 $. For $x$-average-free initial data of size $μ^γ$, solutions are nonlinearly stable; however, for certain initial data, the solution departs from the linear dynamics at rate $μ^{γ-1}$ due to a first-order nonlinear instability. The exponent $γ= 5/6$ is optimal for the associated energy functional and cannot be improved in Sobolev spaces without secondary transient-growth mechanisms. Below this threshold, solutions necessarily transition away from the linear dynamics at a minimal rate.\n  As a consequence, the $3d$ results yield sharp Sobolev stability thresholds for the $2d$ MHD equations around Couette flow without a constant magnetic field. In particular, the threshold is strictly larger than in prior $2d$ results with a constant field, revealing destabilizing effects normally suppressed by a constant magnetic field. Crucially, this stabilization is restricted to the direction of the magnetic field."}

As the particle number grows to infinity and their size goes to zero we derive the monokinetic Vlasov-Stokes equations as mean-field limit. We do this under the assumption that the particles have initial velocities given by a Lipschitz velocity profile and prove the mean-field limit for times of the order of the inverse Lipschitz constant. Notably this is not a perturbative result. In particular, we do not require the inertia of the particles to vanish in the limit.
