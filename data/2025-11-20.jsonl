The underlying idea is to describe solutions of Gelfand problems via suitably defined constrained problems of free boundary-type arising in plasma physics and to replace the usual $L^\\infty$ norm of the solution with the energy of the plasma. Toward this goal, we first solve a long standing open problem of independent interest about the uniqueness of solutions of Grad-Shafranov type equations. Thus, we exploit these unique solutions to detect a curve containing both minimal and non minimal solutions of the associated Gelfand problem. In other words we come up with a new global parametrization of the Rabinowitz continuum, the monotonicity of the energy along the branch providing a meaningful generalization of the classical pointwise monotonicity property of minimal solutions, suitable to describe non minimal solutions as well. On a ball in any dimension, we come up as expected with a bell-shaped profile of the full branch of solutions of the Gelfand problem."}

The goal is to determine a distribution on a bounded one-dimensional domain that maximizes the total population at equilibrium. Previous works have shown that optimal resources are bang-bang, and in one dimension, a sufficiently large dispersal rate forces the optimal resource to be concentrated. For general dispersal rates, however, the analysis becomes more difficult because the equilibrium population may behave irregularly, and the optimal resource may be fragmented. To address this, we introduce a block decomposition that reduces fragmented resources to a collection of concentrated blocks. We then define an advantage function, which measures the gain in the equilibrium population obtained by allocating resources on a fixed interval and is used to analyze the contribution of each block to the total population. This function also allows us to reformulate the optimization problem as a convexity analysis of the advantage function. We prove the superlinearity of this function when the total resource is small enough, and this property leads to an explicit characterization of the optimal control with sufficiently small total resource."}

Generic perturbations generate diffusion waves, and structural conditions fail for multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates. These two aspects have posed significant challenges and left the problem unresolved for years. On one hand, since \\cite{LX}, the study of the entropy wave has been based on the left-right structural conditions. Without these structural conditions, the decay rates of lower-order terms become too slow to close the {\\it a priori} assumption. On the other hand, the presence of diffusion waves yields problematic error terms in the perturbation system. In this work, we introduce a new transformation to ensure that both left-right structural conditions hold for the perturbation system. Additionally, using the fact that the derivative of the entropy wave maintains a fixed sign, we employ well-designed weighted energy estimates to control the slowly decaying terms. This enables us to establish asymptotic stability and derive the optimal decay rate. Furthermore, we address the case of initial perturbations with the zero mass condition and obtain the optimal decay rate by additionally developing a Poincaré type inequality and a key cancellation."}

Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances.

We establish the strong $\\mathrm L^1_{\\mathrm{loc}}$-convergence of weak solutions $u_\\varepsilon$ toward the entropy-admissible solution of the corresponding local conservation law as the kernel $γ_\\varepsilon$ concentrates to a Dirac delta distribution when $\\varepsilon \\searrow 0$. In contrast to previous literature, we obtain compactness of the family $\\{u_\\varepsilon \\ast γ_\\varepsilon\\}_{\\varepsilon>0}$ without relying on total variation bounds or Oleĭnik-type estimates. Instead, we establish $\\mathrm L^2$-type bounds on its entropy production and use the theory of compensated compactness, assuming that the initial datum merely belongs to $\\mathrm L^1\\cap \\mathrm L^\\infty$. Our results are twofold. First, we establish the nonlocal-to-local limit for the piecewise constant kernel $γ(\\cdot) := {1}_{[-1,0]}(\\cdot)$ combined with the affine velocity function from Greenshields' traffic model. Second, we prove the limit for strictly monotone kernels along with decreasing velocity functions. These results settle a long-standing open problem concerning the nonlocal-to-local convergence for non-convex kernels."}

In particular, we prove the existence of far-from-equilibrium patterns exhibiting branch-switching and discontinuities in the nondiffusive components, which cannot occur in classical reaction-diffusion equations. While previous work has linked DDI to instability in the purely nondiffusive subsystem -- thereby destabilizing all regular Turing patterns -- we show that DDI can also arise from subsystems involving nondiffusive and slow-diffusive components. This leads to simple sufficient conditions for DDI in systems with arbitrary numbers of components. Further, we fully classify all possible sources of DDI in the case of two diffusive and one nondiffusive component, illustrating our results with a receptor-based model supported by numerical bifurcation analysis and simulations. These findings extend the theoretical foundations of pattern formation, demonstrating how coupling between diffusive and nondiffusive dynamics can generate patterns beyond the reach of the classical reaction-diffusion framework."}

The nonlinearity $g$ is continuous and satisfies general subcritical growth assumptions of the Berestycki-Lions type. The problem is approached using variational methods within a non-standard functional setting. The natural energy functional associated with the equation is defined on the space $X^1(\\mathbb{R}^N)$, which is the completion of $H^1(\\mathbb{R}^N)$ with respect to the norm induced by the quadratic part of the functional. We establish the existence of a nontrivial solution $u_0 \\in X^1(\\mathbb{R}^N)$ that satisfies the Pohožaev constraint $\\mathcal{M}$ and minimizes the energy functional on $\\mathcal{M}$. Furthermore, assuming $g$ is odd, we prove the existence of at least one non-radial solution."}
