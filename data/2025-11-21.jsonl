In particular, we establish convergence of the scaled ILW dynamics to that of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in the shallow-water limit at the $L^2$-level. Together with the recent work by the first three authors and D. Pilod (2024) on the deep-water convergence in $L^2$, this work completes the well-posedness and convergence study of ILW on both geometries within the $L^2$-framework. Our proof equally applies to both geometries and is based on the following two ingredients: the complete integrability of ILW and the normal form method. More precisely, by making use of the Lax pair structure and the perturbation determinant for ILW, recently introduced by Harrop-Griffths, Killip, and Vişan (2025), we first establish weakly uniform (in small depth parameters) equicontinuity in $L^2$ of solutions to the scaled ILW, providing a control on the high frequency part of solutions. Then, we treat the low frequency part by implementing a perturbative argument based on an infinite iteration of normal form reductions for KdV."}

This result addresses the two primary limitations of the qualitative result [H.-Sueur, 2025] obtained in collaboration with Franck Sueur: first, it bypasses the non-constructive Hahn-Banach theorem used in [H.-Sueur, 2025], precluding quantitative estimates; and second, it extends the scope of the theory from interior approximations to the physically important initial-boundary value problem. Our proof is founded on the modern quantitative framework of [Rüland-Salo, 2019], which we adapt to the Stokes system by combining semigroup theory with a quantitative approximation for the associated resolvent problem."}

We introduce the notion of mild solutions to this system, and prove its existence, uniqueness, and optimal regularity estimates when the initial string configuration is $C^1$ and satisfies the well-stretched condition and when the initial flow field $u_0$ lies in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $p\\in (2,\\infty)$. A blow-up criterion is also established. When the Reynolds number is sent to zero, we show convergence in short time of the solution to that of the Stokes case of 2-D immersed boundary problem, with the optimal error estimates derived. We prove the energy law of the system when $u_0$ additionally belongs to $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.

We first analyze the long-term behavior of the system, showing that it follows a spreading-vanishing dichotomy: the two species either spread across the entire region or eventually die out. In the case of spreading, we determine the asymptotic spreading speed of the fronts by using a semi-wave system and provide sharp estimates for the moving fronts. Additionally, we show that the solution to the system converges to the corresponding semi-wave solution as time tends to infinity. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics of cooperative species in reaction-diffusion systems with free boundaries."}

These domains arise as nontrivial perturbations of some classical symmetric solutions to the same problem. Our approach relies on an implicit construction based on the Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, which allows us to detect branches of non-radial solutions bifurcating from a family of radial ones. The resulting examples highlight new geometric configurations of the torsion problem in the three-dimensional sphere, providing another proof of the fact that the rigidity of Serrin-type results can fail in the presence of curvature."}
