John model and Cummins' equations for freely floating objects", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we address the well-posedness theory of F. John's problem for freely floating objects in a two-dimensional framework. This problem is a linear description of the interactions between an incompressible, irrotational free-surface fluid and a partially immersed solid object. It is related to the Cummins equations, which are a set of coupled integro-differential equations widely used by naval engineers. Our results provide a rigorous justification of this model and the first proof of its well-posedness. To this end, we show that F. John's problem has a Hamiltonian structure, albeit with a non-definite Hamiltonian which compels us to work in a semi-Hilbertian framework. The presence of corners in the fluid domain also induces a lack of elliptic regularity for the boundary value problem satisfied by the velocity potential. This is why the solution to F. John's problem has in general a limited regularity, even with very smooth initial data. Correspondingly, the solution to Cummins' equation is in general no better than $C^3$. We demonstrate higher regularity when the contact angles are small or equal to $π/2$, provided that some compatibility conditions, propagated by the flow, are satisfied. This allows us to exhibit qualitative differences between the three degrees of freedom of the object. For instance, the motion of an object allowed to move only vertically can be $C^\\infty$, while it cannot be better than $C^3$ if it is only allowed to translate horizontally."}

While local well-posedness in $H^1$ is classical, the long-time dynamics in the supercritical regime remains largely unexplored beyond small data global solutions, the construction of multi-solitons for any power and self-similar blow-up near the critical power $p=5$. We develop a unified description of the non-solitonic region for arbitrary $H^1$ solutions, both global and blowing up. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic $L^2$ and $L^p$ dynamics in this region is completely determined by the growth rate of the $L^2$ norm of the gradient (or, equivalently, the critical $H^{s_p}$ norm). In particular, we prove sharp far-field decay on both half-lines and establish normalized local vanishing along sequences of times, with improved estimates in the case of even-power nonlinearities. A key ingredient is a new virial method that compensates for the possible unboundedness of the $H^1$ norm by exploiting the conservation of mass and a careful localization of the nonlinear flux. This yields quantitative versions of decay phenomena previously known only in subcritical settings, and it applies without any smallness or proximity-to-soliton assumptions."}

Such flows arise naturally in the theory of biharmonic maps and geometric variational problems involving bending energy. We first establish the global existence of smooth solutions to the associated initial value problem, assuming appropriate conditions on the forcing term. The analysis is performed through a reformulation of the geometric flow using the support function, enabling a scalar PDE characterization of the evolution. Under specific geometric constraints, we demonstrate that the governing equation admits a Monge Ampére type structure that can exhibit hyperbolic behavior. Furthermore, we prove that convexity is preserved during the evolution and derive sufficient conditions ensuring long time convergence to steady-state solutions. Our results extend recent developments in geometric analysis by clarifying the role of forcing terms in stabilizing high order curvature flows and enhancing their qualitative behavior."}

This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift."}

The system governs perturbations about a motionless basic state with a linear temperature profile in a periodic channel, where the temperature is fixed at $T_0$ and $T_1$ on the bottom and upper boundaries, respectively. Through a rigorous analysis of three distinct thermal regimes, we identify a critical temperature difference $T_c$ that fundamentally dictates the system's dynamical transitions. Our main contributions are fourfold. Firstly, in the subcritical case $T_0 - T_1 < T_c$, we use energy methods to establish the global nonlinear stability in $H^2$-norm, proving that perturbations decay exponentially. Secondly, precisely at the critical threshold $T_0 - T_1 = T_c$, we prove not only the nonlinear stability in $H^1$-norm but also the asymptotic convergence of all solutions to zero, leveraging spectral and dynamical systems theory. Finally, in the supercritical regime $T_0 - T_1 > T_c$, a bootstrap argument reveals that the basic state is nonlinearly unstable across all $L^p$-norms for $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. Finally, near the critical point, the dynamics are first reduced to a two-dimensional system on a center manifold. This reduced system then undergoes a supercritical bifurcation, generating a countable family of stable steady states that are organized into a local ring attractor. This work closes a significant gap in the stability analysis of the thermally driven primitive equations, establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the formation of convection cells in large-scale geophysical flows."}

These results hold when the damping or control is localized in a region where observability for the linear Schrödinger equation is known to hold. At the core of these results lies a new unique continuation property for the nonlinear plate equation, which significantly relaxes the geometric conditions required for such property to hold. This property is obtained by combining recent results on propagation of analyticity in time and unique continuation for linear plate operators. More broadly, our approach exploits the linear observability of the plate equation to establish both stabilization and control results. First, we prove exponential decay of the nonlinear energy under a defocusing assumption on the nonlinearity. Second, under a weaker asymptotic assumption on the nonlinearity, we prove semiglobal exact control by analyzing control properties inside the compact attractor provided by the dynamics of the damped equation."}
