All comments are welcome", "summary": "This paper is concerned with the Cauchy problem of the evolutionary Faddeev model, a system that maps from the Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ to the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$. The model is a system of nonlinear wave equations whose nonlinearities exhibit a null structure and include semilinear terms, quasilinear terms, and the unknowns themselves. By considering a class of large initial data (in energy norm) of the short pulse type, we prove that the evolutionary Faddeev model admits a globally smooth solution via energy estimates. The main result is achieved through the selection of appropriate multipliers that are specially adapted to the geometry of the system."}

The first main contribution of this work is the derivation of an inhomogeneous Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality adapted to the unbounded weight, which provides the necessary control over the nonlinear term in terms of Sobolev norms. Building on this inequality, we then investigate the long-time behavior of solutions and establish a sharp dichotomy: solutions with initial data below the ground state energy either exist globally in time or experience finite-time blow-up. A distinctive feature of our results is that the analysis of the unbounded inhomogeneous term requires the imposition of radial symmetry on the initial data, which allows us to exploit certain Strauss type Sobolev estimates that would not hold in the general non-radial case. This work complements previous studies on biharmonic Schrödinger equations with singular inhomogeneities, highlighting both the challenges and the new phenomena that arise when the nonlinearity is weighted by a growing up unbounded function, which broke the space translation invariance of the standard homogeneous associated equation."}

In particular, we consider a two-dimensional lattice structure and determine how different choices of the spanning vectors influence the resulting dynamical tramsitions and pattern formations. As the basic steady-state loses its linear stability, the binary system undergoes a dynamic transition which is shown to be characterized by both the geometry of the domain and the choice of physical parameters of the model. Unlike rectangular domains, we are able to observe the emergence of hexagonally-packed circles, as well as the familiar rolls and square structures. We begin with the decomposition of our function space into a stable and unstable eigenspace before calculating the center manifold that maps the former to the later. In analyzing the resulting reduced equations, we consider the different multiplicities that the critical eigenvalue can have, which is shown to be geometry-dependent. We briefly consider the long-range interaction model and determine that it produces similar results to the original model."}

These models are characterized by coefficients $α$ and $β$ in the Collatz dynamics, and are suitably defined. Here, $α=β=1$, and $α=3$, $β=1$ correspond to the Nollatz and classical Collatz operators, respectively. In general, the first evolution model is a continuum, Fourier side based, motivated by the Cubic Szegő operator of Gérard and Grellier. The second evolution considers discrete time derivatives of the Collatz orbits. In this paper we describe the evolution of both models, with particular emphasis on dynamical properties. For the first one, it is proved local and global existence in the space $L^2(\\mathbb T)$, and a one-to-one characterization of the existence of nontrivial periodic and unbounded orbits of the Collatz mapping in terms of particular set of solutions of this continuous Collatz flow. For the discrete part, a sort of discrete energy is introduced. This energy has the property of being conserved by the discrete flow. An estimate of each term in this energy is given, proving suitable growth bounds. Finally, the meaning of the discrete time derivative for the generalized Collatz orbits is discussed. It is proved that, except for the Nollatz and Collatz operators, the sum of coefficients related to this discrete time derivative is an increasing sequence in $n$ as the iteration parameter $n$ evolves."}

The relativistic formulation provides a physically consistent setting for multi-species systems where inertia and internal energy depend on temperature, as occurs in astrophysical plasmas or relativistic fluids.

The main difficulty lies in the proof of the instability result, for which we explicitly construct an escape function associated to the dynamics. This is obtained by means of a positive commutator estimate on the operator associated with the escape function, exploiting microlocal analysis."}

Our framework covers the full scales of Besov and Sobolev spaces, $B^s_{p,q}$ and $H^{s,p}$, including endpoint cases such as $L^\\infty$. Our approach also allows extending the classical $L^p$-theory for $1\\leqslant p\\leqslant\\infty$, giving a complete picture that includes both Bessel potential spaces $H^{s,p}$ and Besov spaces $B^s_{p,q}$, $p,q\\in[1,\\infty]$.\\\\ Our first main result establishes resolvent estimates in the half-space encompassing endpoint function spaces, while the second addresses bounded domains of minimal boundary regularity. In both cases we derive resolvent bounds, prove boundedness of the $\\mathbf{H}^\\infty$-functional calculus for the Stokes--Dirichlet operator, and characterize precisely the domains of its fractional powers.\\\\ In the half space setting, we work with homogeneous Sobolev and Besov spaces following the notion due to Bahouri, Chemin and Danchin, further refined by the second author. The analysis of solenoidal function spaces provides here a complete toolkit for the study of incompressible fluid flows. As a consequence of our analysis, we obtain an explicit description for the Stokes--Dirichlet operator on $L^\\infty(\\mathbb R^n_+)$, which seems completely new.\\\\ For bounded domains, we obtain sharp results for a wide class of rough domains under minimal assumptions on boundary regularity. To this end, we rely on Sobolev multiplier theory. The assumptions coincide with those of Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova, already shown to be optimal in the case of the Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions."}

Such solutions correspond to heteroclinic trajectories $γ$ of a system of ODE. In general conditions of stability can be obtained only numerically. We propose a model class of piece-wise linear (discontinuous) vector fields $F$ for which the stability problem is reduced to a linear algebra problem. We show that the stability problem makes sense in such low regularity and construct several examples of stability loss. Every such example can be smoothed to provide a smooth example of the same phenomenon."}

Finally, we prove that halfspaces are global minimizers of the generalized nonlocal perimeters and act as attractors for the dynamics.
