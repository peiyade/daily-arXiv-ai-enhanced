For the Robin Laplacian, Payne and Schaefer (2001) formulated an analogous conjecture, positing that the ratio $μ_2/μ_1$ is also maximized by a disk for a range of the boundary parameter $σ$.

To shed light on this transition mechanism, Trefethen et al.({\\it \\small Science 1993}) proposed the transition threshold problem, aiming to quantify the magnitude of perturbations required to trigger instability and determine their scaling with the Reynolds number. In this paper, we investigate the transition threshold of Couette flow for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system in the high Reynolds number regime ($\\mathrm{Re}\\gg 1$). By exploiting the combined effects of rotation (dispersion) and mixing mechanisms, we derive an improved stability threshold scaling in $\\mathrm{Re}$.

Additionally, we introduce a new dispersive structure for the zero modes and derive suitable Strichartz-type estimates. These tools enable us to exploit both the nonlinear structure and the improved dispersive behavior of certain good components of the zero modes, which play a crucial role in achieving the improved stability threshold."}

By synthesizing viscosity solution theory, optimal control formulation, and variational analysis, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and explicit variational representation of the viscosity solution. The solution is characterized by a fundamental solution constructed via optimal paths, revealing a critical transition in propagation behavior governed by a geometrically derived curve that separates rectilinear and road-assisted regimes. Our framework extends to non-order-preserving systems where classical comparison methods fail, and we provide a detailed asymptotic derivation of the Wentzell boundary condition from flux continuity principles.

The model's inelasticity is measured by the so-called restitution coefficient which, for viscoelastic particles, depends on the relative velocities of particles. Through a suitable self-similar change of variables, a balanced dynamic between energy inflow and outflow naturally emerges in the model which permits its analysis. In contrast, such balanced dynamic does not emerge naturally in the constant restitution case and has to be imposed in our previous contribution (Alonso, Lods, Tristani, Mémoires SMF). The exact self-similar rescaling, which allows to capture nontrivial inelastic-hydrodynamic effects, presents itself explicitly in terms of the Knudsen number and the restitution coefficient. The consequence of such scaling is a non-autonomous rescaled Boltzmann equation whose solutions converge, in a specific weak sense, towards the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit.
