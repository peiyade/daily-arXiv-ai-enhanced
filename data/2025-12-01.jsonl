In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations."}

While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D Córdoba-Córdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schrödinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs."}

Our approach is based on a Wasserstein-Łojasiewicz gradient inequality for the associated free energy, established under mild analyticity assumptions on the confinement and interaction potentials; this yields convergence of the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow without any convexity assumptions and without postulating log-Sobolev related functional inequalities. We expect this strategy to extend to more general nonconvex Wasserstein gradient flows; in the present work we develop it in the McKean-Vlasov setting, with the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model on the torus as a key application."}

It appears naturally as the hydrodynamic limit of a branching-selection particle system, the $N$-BBM. In the present work, we show that for any initial condition $u_0(dx)$ that decays fast enough as $x\\to\\infty$, the solution of the free boundary problem converges to the minimal travelling wave solution. We further show how the decay of the initial condition precisely determines the position of the free boundary $L_t$ at large times $t$, mirroring the celebrated results of Bramson \\cite{Bramson1983} in the context of the FKPP equation. Our conditions for convergence to the minimal travelling wave, and for $L_t$ to have the Bramson asymptotics \\[ L_t=\\sqrt{2}t-\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\log t+c+o(1)\\quad\\text{as }t\\to\\infty,\\] are necessary and sufficient. We also apply our results to a more general free boundary problem that depends on a parameter $β$, where we see a transition from \\emph{pulled} to \\emph{pushed} behaviour (with \\emph{pushmi-pullyu} behaviour at the critical value of $β$). We obtain analogous sharp conditions for convergence to the minimal travelling wave, along with precise asymptotics for the front position, in each of these regimes. To our knowledge, such necessary and sufficient conditions had not previously been established in the pushmi-pullyu or pushed regimes, even for classical monostable reaction-diffusion equations. Our results prove and extend non-rigorous predictions in the physics literature of the first author, Brunet and Derrida."}
