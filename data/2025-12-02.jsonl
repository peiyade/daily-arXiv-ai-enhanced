We combine time-domain integral equations, Laplace transforms, and Hardy-Sobolev space techniques to analyze this system, establishing its unique solvability in anisotropic Hilbert spaces, with solutions expressed as convergent Neumann series of convolution operators.

In particular, we show convergence of weak solutions of the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation to weak solutions of a corresponding anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation for suitable subsequences. Moreover, we show existence of weak solutions for the nonlocal equation under a condition, which guarantees existence of weak solutions for suitably localized or singular kernels."}

As the parameters vary, some existence results are established. Specifically, a ground state solution is obtained for some general cases. The existence of two solutions is established for the mass-supercritical case, one of which is a ground state solution and the other one is an excited state solution. We develop a compactness method to deal with the functionals involving logarithmic convolution terms. The Pohožaev identity for the coupled Schrödinger-Poisson system with a logarithmic convolution term is also shown, which is crucial for addressing the mass-supercritical problem."}

These notes are meant as a survey on this rich theory, with a particular stress on applications to initial-boundary value problems with unbounded boundary feedbacks. A diffusion-transport system with dynamical boundary conditions is discussed, and its well-posedness and various other properties are investigated. As a by-product, the well-posedness of a wave equation with dynamical boundary condition is also obtained."}

Previous works have shown that the strict monotonicity of the vorticity profile leads to axisymmetrization and inviscid damping of non-radial perturbations.\n  Given any strictly decreasing radial vortex, we construct arbitrarily close (in low Hölder norms $C^α$, with $0<α< 1$) radial profiles that are merely non-increasing, for which non-radial, time-periodic solutions to the linearized equation exist. This shows that both axisymmetrization and inviscid damping are not robust under small, low-regularity perturbations of the background profile that violate strict monotonicity."}

Specifically, we characterize the resonant frequencies as the zeros of an explicit trigonometric polynomial. Leveraging Nevanlinna's value distribution theory, we establish the distribution properties of the resonances and demonstrate that their imaginary parts are uniformly bounded, which contrasts with the three-dimensional case. In two classes of high-contrast regimes, we derive the asymptotics of both subwavelength and non-subwavelength resonances with respect to the contrast parameter. Furthermore, by applying the Newton polygon method, we recover the discrete capacitance matrix approximation for subwavelength Minnaert resonances in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases, thereby establishing its connection to the propagation matrix framework."}

We examine two scenarios: first, when hybrid dissipation is the sole dissipative mechanism, and second, when it complements other dissipative mechanisms. In the first case, we demonstrate that hybrid dissipation fails to induce exponential decay, instead producing a slow decay rate of $t^{-1/2}$ for large $t$. In the second case, when acting as a complementary mechanism, hybrid dissipation neither enhances nor diminishes the decay behavior of the original model."}
