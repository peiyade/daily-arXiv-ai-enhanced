As the interface self-intersects, Sobolev norms remain bounded, although analyticity is necessarily lost. This contrasts classical splash singularities, in which solutions remain analytic up to the time of self-intersection.\n  The narrowing gap bounded by these arcs is not occupied by plasma, as squeezing the plasma itself would cause blow-up in Sobolev norms. Instead, the gap represents the region outside the plasma, a vacuum carrying a nontrivial magnetic field. The plasma on either side pinches the field as the gap closes, and, in response, the field flattens to infinite order at the intersection point (and nowhere else), thereby forming an analytic singularity. This gives the first example of analytic breakdown without Sobolev blow-up in a locally well-posed free-boundary incompressible fluid system, and can be viewed as the first rigorous construction of a squeeze-type singularity, in which we study and quantify the precise behavior of an active, incompressible vector field as it is completely pinched off by a free-boundary in finite time.\n  The proof combines a magnetically-aligned Lagrangian formulation of ideal MHD together with weighted elliptic estimates in the vacuum that remain uniform as the width of the gap tends to zero. Our framework may provide a starting point for the analysis of squeeze-type singularities in other incompressible fluid models."}

In [J. Math. Pures Appl. 148 (2021), pp. 199-220] Chipot posed the question of \\textit{how many scalar measurements are needed to have a Korn-type control on $\\nabla u$} when $u$ is in $H_0^1(Ω)$ and $H^1(Ω)$, introducing the minimal numbers $N(d,Ω)$ and $N'(d,Ω)$ respectively. He proved general bounds and calculated several low-dimensional values of $N,N'$.\n  We reframe Chipot's problem in the language of rank-one convexity and quasiconvexity and obtain a purely algebraic characterisation of when such inequalities hold, which yields the sharp bounds \\begin{align*}\n  N(d,Ω)&=2d(1-o(1))\\\\ N'(d,Ω)&=2d-1. \\end{align*} As a consequence, we recover and streamline several of Chipot's results, we obtain a dimension-optimal Korn inequality and several sharp estimates for the best constant for various Korn-type inequalities. Generalisations to the rectangular case and to general $L^p$ estimates are also considered.\\par The central new ingredient of our approach is a systematic connection between laminates and martingales which produces explicit families of laminates realising these bounds. This method is of independent interest in the calculus of variations: for instance, we use it to obtain a new quick and quantitative proof of Ornstein's non-inequality, valid for all first order homogeneous operators in $\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times 2}$ and for a large class of operators in general dimensions (including Korn's $\\frac{\\nabla u+\\nabla u^t}2$ and $\\frac{\\nabla u+\\nabla u^t}2-\\mathrm{div}(u)\\frac{\\mathrm{Id}}d$)."}

In this model, the agents move at constant speed and control the curvature of their trajectory (i.e. the time-derivative of their velocity) so as to align their velocity with that of their neighbors, up to some noise. We provide a novel $n$-dimensional formulation of this model for any $n \\geq 3$ and derive its mean-field kinetic formulation using bundle geometry concepts. The target of the paper is the derivation of a fluid model in the hydrodynamic limit. We show that this fluid model is the \"self-organized hydrodynamic\" (SOH) model already found in earlier work pertaining to the Vicsek model. The derivation is based on the introduction of appropriate \"generalized collision invariants\" (GCI). The action of the $n$-dimensional orthogonal group is used to reduce the expression of the GCI to a set of two functions satisfying a system of equations which is solved by means of a variational formulation. This leads to explicit formulas for the coefficients of the SOH model in terms of those of the original interacting particle system."}
