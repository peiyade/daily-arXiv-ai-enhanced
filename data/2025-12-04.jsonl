Peletier", "Anna Shalova"], "title": "Nonlinear diffusion limit of non-local interactions on a sphere", "comment": "44 pages", "summary": "We study an aggregation PDE with competing attractive and repulsive forces on a sphere of arbitrary dimension. In particular, we consider the limit of strongly localized repulsion with a constant attraction term. We prove convergence of solutions of such a system to solutions of the aggregation-diffusion equation with a porous-medium-type diffusion term. The proof combines variational techniques with elements of harmonic analysis on a sphere. In particular, we characterize the square root of the convolution operator in terms of the spherical harmonics, which allows us to overcome difficulties arising due to the convolution on a sphere being non-commutative. The study is motivated by the toy model of transformers introduced by Geshkovski et al. (2025); and we discuss the applicability of the results to this model."}

Leveraging a quantified analyticity-sparseness gap, we introduce a time-weighted bridge inequality across derivative levels and a focused-extremizer hypothesis capturing peak concentration at a fixed point. Together with a harmonic-measure contraction on one-dimensional sparse sets, these mechanisms enforce quantitative decay of high-derivative $L^{\\infty}-$norms and rule out blow-up. Under scale-refined, slowly varying time weights, solutions extend analytically past the prospective singular time, thereby refining the analyticity-sparseness framework, complementing recent exclusions of rapid-rate blow-up scenarios, and remaining consistent with recent non-uniqueness results."}

Furthermore, we prove a Lorentzian version of the Graham-Zworski theorem relating poles of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map to conformally invariant powers of the boundary wave operator."}

The equation involves Caputo time-derivatives of orders $α, σ_1, σ_2$ and a non-local operator $φ(Δ)$ generated by a Bernstein function $φ$. We first establish the local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions in the $L_p$-framework for $1 \\leq p \\leq 2$. For the case $p > 2$, where the $L_p$-theory fails, we develop a Sobolev space framework based on the scales of Besov and Triebel--Lizorkin spaces associated with $φ(Δ)$. Within this setting, we prove the solvability and regularity of weak solutions. Our analysis relies on detailed estimates of the fundamental solutions, stochastic convolutions, Littlewood--Paley theory, and a fixed point argument. The results presented here extend and unify several previous works on fractional SPDEs by incorporating a general class of non-local operators and Lévy noises."}

We extend the method to both banded Toeplitz operators and those with algebraically decaying, fully dense off-diagonal structure. We present sharp decay estimates for the amplitude of bulk eigenmodes as well as eigenmodes associated with defect eigenfrequencies inside the spectral band gap. The validity of those results is illustrated numerically and we show that banded approximations give poor reconstructions of the dense operators, due to the slow algebraic decay. We apply the insights gained to model the non-Hermitian skin effect in a three-dimensional system of subwavelength resonators, where the corresponding operator exhibits only algebraic decay of off-diagonal entries. We use our approach to demonstrate the fundamental mechanism responsible for the transition between the non-Hermitian skin effect and defect-induced localisation in the bulk."}

The first eigenvalue is always negative. We show that if the second eigenvalue is positive then there are no waves with multiple periods in a neighborhood of the Stokes wave."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "In this paper, we establish the well-posedness of Cauchy problems for weak solutions to second-order degenerate parabolic equations with a non-smooth, time-dependent degenerate elliptic part that includes both bounded and unbounded lower-order terms. The unbounded lower-order terms are allowed to lie in mixed time-space Lebesgue or even Lorentz spaces. Our notion of weak solutions is formulated under minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution, which coincides with the associated evolution family for the homogeneous problem (i.e., with zero source term) and provides a representation formula for all weak solutions. We also establish $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates for the fundamental solution and derive Gaussian upper bounds under the weak assumption of Moser's $L^2$-$L^\\infty$ estimates for weak solutions. Our approach is purely variational and avoids any a priori regularity assumptions on weak solutions or regularization via smooth approximations. Two key ingredients are norm inequalities for fractional powers of the degenerate Laplacian, and a set of embeddings that ensure time continuity of weak solutions, extending the classical Lions regularity theorem and accommodating a wide class of source terms."}
