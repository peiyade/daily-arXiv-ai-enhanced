We consider the problem of brittle failure in an elastic bar previously solved in (Rosakis et al 2021). Despite the presence of a non-zero interfacial/surface energy, the third derivative of the inverse-deformation map is discontinuous at the crack faces. This is due to the presence of the inequality constraint ensuring the inverse strain is nonnegative and the orientation of matter is preserved. A change in the material location of a crack results in negative entropy production, violating the second law. Consequently, such changes are disallowed giving the irreversibility condition. The inequality constraint and the irreversibility condition limit the space of admissible variations. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability that incorporate these restrictions. Their numerical implementation shows that all broken equilibria found in (Rosakis et al 2021) are locally stable."}

The aim is the derivation of effective models for $\\varepsilon\\to 0 $, when the thickness of the layer tends to zero. For the flow problem we consider incompressible Stokes equations with a pressure boundary condition on the top/bottom of the layer, and the transport problem is given by reaction-diffusion-advection problem with advective flow governed from the fluid velocity from the Stokes model and different scalings for the diffusion coefficient modelling low and fast diffusion in the horizontal direction. In the limit, a Darcy-type law is obtained for the Stokes flow with Darcy-velocity depending only on the derivative of the Darcy-pressure in the vertical direction. The effective equation for the transport problem is again of diffusion-advection-type including homogenized coefficients, and with advective flow given by the Darcy-velocity and only taking place in the vertical direction. In the case of slow diffusion in the vertical direction, effective diffusion only takes place in the vertical direction, where in the case of high diffusion in horizontal direction, we obtain effective diffusion in all space directions. To pass to the limit we use the method of two-scale convergence adapted to our microscopic geometry, which is based on uniform a priori estimates. Critical parts in the derivation of the macro-models are the control of the fluid pressure, for which we construct a Bogovskii-operator for thin perforated domains, as well as the strong two-scale convergence for the microscopic solution of the transport equation, necessary to pass to the limit in the advective term."}

Under stronger conditions on the fluxes, we provide a strictly convex entropy for the hyperbolic system that corresponds to the energy of the underlying dispersive equation. To approximate diffusive-dispersive equations, we rely on a viscoelastic damped system that is compatible with the found entropy for the hyperbolic approximation of the dispersive evolution. For the resulting hyperbolic-parabolic approximation, we provide a global well-posedness result. Using the relative entropy framework \\cite{dafermos2005hyperbolic}, we prove that the solutions of the approximate systems converge to solutions of the original equations. The structure of the new approximate systems allows to apply standard numerical simulation methods from the field of hyperbolic balance laws. We confirm the convergence of our approximations even beyond the validity range of our theoretical findings on set of test cases covering different target equations.
