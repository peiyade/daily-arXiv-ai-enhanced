Increased platelet adhesion or protein adsorption on the device surface can induce platelet aggregation or thrombosis, which is analogous to the ``blow-up phenomenon\" in mathematical modeling. Here we mathematically analyze this stability mechanism and demonstrate that sufficiently strong flow can prevent blow-up from occurring. In details, we investigate the two-dimensional Patlak-Keller-Segel-Navier-Stokes system in an annular domain around a Taylor-Couette flow $U(r,θ)=A\\big(r+\\frac{1}{r} \\big)(-\\sinθ, \\cosθ)^{T}$ with $(r,θ)\\in[1,R]\\times\\mathbb{S}^{1}$, and prove that the solutions are globally bounded without any smallness restriction on the initial cell mass or velocity when $A$ is large."}

Lin and Wang (Ann. Math. 2010) proved that $G(z)$ has either $3$ or $5$ critical points (depending on the choice of $τ$). Here we study the sum of two Green functions which can be reduced to $G_p(z):=\\frac12(G(z+p)+G(z-p))$. In Part I \\cite{CFL}, we proved that for any $p$ satisfying $p\\neq -p$ in $E_τ$, the number of critical points of $G_p(z)$ belongs to $\\{4,6,8,10\\}$ (depending on the choice of $(τ, p)$) and each number really occurs.\n  In the Part II of this series, we study the important case $τ=ib$ with $b>0$, i.e. $E_τ$ is a rectangular torus. By developing a completely different approach from Part I, we show the existence of $8$ real values $d_1<d_2<\\cdots<d_7<d_8$ such that if $$\\wp(p)\\in (-\\infty, d_1]\\cup [d_2, d_3]\\cup [d_4, d_5]\\cup [d_6, d_7]\\cup [d_8,+\\infty),$$ then $G_p(z)$ has no nontrivial critical points; if $$\\wp(p)\\in (d_1, d_2)\\cup (d_3, d_4)\\cup (d_5, d_6)\\cup (d_7, d_8),$$ then $G_p(z)$ has a unique pair of nontrivial critical points that are always non-degenerate saddle points. This allows us to study the possible distribution of the numbers of critical points of $G_p(z)$ for generic $p$. Applications to the Painlevé VI equation and the curvature equation are also given."}

As well, this result has been extended by some authors to the case of the IBVP. In this note, we achieve the Théorème de Structure by means of a new proof. Our proof is based on a priori estimates for a suitable approximating sequence. In this way our result covers a more general setting in the sense that, e.g., we can also include the case of the weak solutions furnished by Hopf for an IBVP in bounded domains without requiring an energy inequality in a strong form, but just employing a priori estimates on the Galerkin approximation."}

In this paper we focus on the special case where the rupture occurs at the origin. According to the different Hénon-type exponents $α$, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of such solutions near the origin and derive a full asymptotic expansion of arbitrary order in a neighborhood of the origin. Moreover, for both radial solutions and non-radial solutions with asymptotic radial condition, we prove the existence of rupture solutions near the rupture point by constructing it."}

The standard bubble provides a family of radial solutions, which are known to be the only positive solutions in convex cones. For nonconvex cones, symmetry breaking may occur and the symmetry breaking is related to the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the domain $D\\subset§^{N-1}$, that spans the cone. We construct a one-parameter family of domains on the sphere whose first eigenvalue crosses the threshold at which the bubble loses stability. Under the assumption that this eigenvalue is simple, we prove, via the Crandall Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, the existence of a branch of nonradial solutions bifurcating from the standard bubble. Moreover we show that the bifurcation is global."}

The energies under consideration consist of a non-convex bulk term and a higher-order regularizing term and are subject to incompatible boundary conditions. In contrast to existing results in the literature, in this work, admissible fields are not necessarily gradient fields, instead their curl is linked to topological singularities, so-called vortices, in the discrete $J_1$-$J_3$-model. The main result of this work is a scaling law for the minimal energy with respect to three parameters: one measuring the incompatibility of the boundary conditions, the second measuring the strength of the regularizing term, and the third being related to the interatomic distance in the discrete model. The shown result implies in particular that in certain parameter regimes, minimizers necessarily develop vortices. A key tool in the analysis is a careful modification of the celebrated ball-construction technique that, due to a lack of rigidity, considers simultaneously both the bulk energy and the regularizing term."}

Miranville", "G. Karali", "A. S. Fokas", "E. C. Aifantis"], "title": "Higher-order diffusion and Cahn-Hilliard-type models revisited on the half-line", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we solve explicitly and analyze rigorously inhomogeneous initial-boundary-value problems (IBVP) for several fourth-order variations of the traditional diffusion equation and the associated linearized Cahn-Hilliard (C-H) model (also Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation), formulated in the spatiotemporal quarter-plane. Such models are of relevance to heat-mass transfer phenomena, solid-fluid dynamics and the applied sciences. In particular, we derive formally effective solution representations, justifying a posteriori their validity. This includes the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary data, which requires careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula is utilized to rigorously deduce the solution's regularity and asymptotic properties near the boundaries of the domain, including uniform convergence, eventual (long-time) periodicity under (eventually) periodic boundary conditions, and null non-controllability. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for exploring the (non)uniqueness of the problem's solution and a new counter-example is constructed. Our work is based on the synergy between: (i) the well-known Fokas unified transform method and (ii) a new approach recently introduced for the rigorous analysis of the Fokas method and for investigating qualitative properties of linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) on semi-infinite strips. Since only up to third-order evolution PDE have been investigated within this novel framework to date, we present our analysis and results in an illustrative manner and in order of progressively greater complexity, for the convenience of readers. The solution formulae established herein are expected to find utility in well-posedness studies for nonlinear counterparts too."}
