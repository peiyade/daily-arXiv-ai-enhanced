Starting from the conservative BDY exchange mechanism, we rely on kinetic theory for multi-agent systems in order to propose an analogue continuous dynamics, which does not belong to the class of other popular kinetic models for wealth exchange. We employ the quasi-invariant limit procedure to rigorously derive a nonlinear PDE on the half-line, which is a Fokker-Planck equation featuring the boundary value in the drift term. The PDE is supplemented with a nonlinear Robin-type boundary condition encoding conservation of total agents and wealth. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution, which converges in relative entropy to the unique stationary state that is the Boltzmann-Gibbs (exponential) distribution. We determine the $L^1$ convergence (up to subsequences) of the solution toward this equilibrium: this requires us to make a step forward with respect to established arguments of entropy decay for Fokker-Planck equations. Thus, our results, which bridge the discrete stochastic dynamics with a continuous deterministic evolution equation, provide a novel and influential wealth exchange model in a PDE framework, which opens up many new applicative scenarios and methodological analytical challenges."}

Since the American put option pricing model is a widely used financial model for valuing an option with the right to sell an underlying asset at a fated price which generally decided in advance. The method we proposed here, solves the problem of early exercise by introducing a front-fixing technique that permits for efficient and accurate valuation of an American put option. As in the comparison to other approaches in the existing literature, we can assert that this method is stable, accurate, consistent, and efficient. The results that we obtained here from the numerical experiments demonstrate not only the efficacy of the proposed method but also in consistently and accurately pricing American put options with a stable scheme. Under some appropriate conditions on the step size discretization, we also show the positivity and monotonicity of the coefficient involved in the numerical scheme used."}

For this model, we demonstrate that the semigroup \\( S(t) \\) belongs to the Gevrey class of order 4, provided the solutions are radial and symmetric.

In this framework, the determining modes property and the reconstruction property can be viewed in a unified way as the ability of certain couplings of the Navier-Stokes equations to self-synchronize; due to the bi-directionality of coupling, the coupled system is referred to as an \"intertwinement.\" A central achievement of this framework is to deduce a conceptual equivalence between the determining modes property and the reconstruction property of continuous data assimilation algorithms. In this paper, we prove that there are at least two non-trivial classes of intertwinements to which this framework applies. Moreover, these intertwinements encompass the continuous data assimilation algorithms studied in (Olson, Titi 2003) and (Azouani, Olson, Titi 2014) as special cases. Specifically, we show that there exist two types of intertwinements that are globally well-posed and we identify conditions under which these intertwinements self-synchronize. We emphasize that the intertwinements studied here can be induced by nonlinear perturbations of the underlying system, which are subsequently coupled bi-directionally to a copy of itself. Thus, establishing global well-posedness and suitable global-in-time uniform bounds, which are crucial to proving the claimed synchronization phenomenon, requires careful consideration."}

To overcome this difficulty, results for the pseudo-parabolic type KWC system in [Antil et al., SIAM J. Math.

We show the existence of positive one-dimensional traveling waves connecting the predator-free state and the constant co-existence state. The set of admissible wave speeds is proved to be equal to the semi-infinite interval $[s^*,\\infty)$, for some $s^*>0$ which is characterized by a variational formula."}

We show that certain penetrable scatterers with rectangular corners scatter every incident wave nontrivially. Even though these scatterers have interior transmission eigenvalues, the far field operator has a trivial kernel at every real frequency. Our approach relies on a special decomposition of the elastic Lamé operator and also provides an alternative idea for treating inverse elastic medium problems with a general polygonal support."}

We establish uniform regularity estimates with respect to the relaxation parameter $\\varepsilon$ and prove the global well-posedness of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem. In addition, we justify the global-in-time strong convergence of the solutions towards those of a general porous medium-type diffusion system, with an explicit rate of convergence, and for ill-prepared initial data. The core of our proof relies on a refined hypocoercivity framework combined with a new time-dependent frequency decomposition, both adapted to handle damping terms with time-dependent coefficients. This enables us to treat the overdamped regime $λ\\in (-\\infty,0)$ and the underdamped regime $λ\\in (0,1)$ for any $μ>0$, and also the borderline critical case $λ=1$ under the improved condition $μ>2\\varepsilon^2$."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "This paper investigates the local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosities in exterior domains. When both the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients depend on the density in a power law ($ρ^δ$ with $0<δ<1$) and Navier-slip boundary condition on the velocity is imposed, base on a reformulation of the problem using new variables to handle the degeneracy near vacuum, we establish the local well-posedness of regular solutions with far-field vacuum in inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces. Compared to the Cauchy problem, the initial-boundary value problem requires establishing non-standard weighted estimates and handling the unavailability of boundary conditions for higher-order terms. Our approach addresses these challenges via the conormal space technique."}

Recently, the short-time asymptotics for equations with dissipative generators were obtained using the hypocoercivity index that is in finite dimensions surprisingly given by a Kalman-type rank condition well-known in control theory. However, the situation for unbounded generators is only understood for index one if modal decompositions are available. Here, we prove long- and short-time estimates for unbounded generators with higher index admitting a modal decomposition. Additionally, an explicit Lyapunov functional is constructed. The result is applied to a class of port-Hamiltonian systems with distributed dissipation."}
