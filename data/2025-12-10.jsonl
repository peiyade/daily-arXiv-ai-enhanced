We establish the relation between discrete and continuous condensing aggregation equations in its most generalized form, where kinetic-kernels with respect to OHS and inverse aggregation equations are not always equal. Convergence criterion is proved under suitable a priori estimates by approximating the continuous equation through a sequence of discrete equations, which subsequently converges towards the solution of the continuous equation by weak compactness principles. Existence of solution to the discrete model and uniform bounds on different order moments over finite time under particular conditions on kinetic-kernels are investigated. We analyze long-time dynamics and blowup of the solution leading to mass-loss or gelation for specific kernels. Three numerical experiments show the accuracy and convergence of approximated solutions to the exact solution of the continuous equation when $\\varepsilon$ approaches zero."}

Our approach relies on the natural Lagrangian change of coordinates and a detailed analysis of the linearized problem (the Stokes system) in the maximal regularity regime, formulated in the Lebesgue spaces $L_p(0,T; L_q)$, including time-weighted variants. The main difficulty lies in the treatment of boundary terms, for which we apply a new technique based on complex interpolation to control nonlinear terms in fractional Sobolev spaces. This strategy also allows us to handle the case of variable density, which is not easily addressed by approaches based on Besov spaces.\n  Using this framework and real interpolation techniques, we construct also solutions in the Lorentz class $L_{p,1}(0,T; L_q)$ in time. The method further enables a rigorous study of the stability of equilibrium configurations. In particular, we resolve the problem in two spatial dimensions, where the interplay between geometry and regularity is especially subtle. Beyond these specific applications, the proposed approach provides a powerful tool for broader classes of nonlinear PDEs and further developments in maximal regularity theory."}

Under properness on bounded sets and a nonzero local index at the given base solution, each branch satisfies the following alternative: either it is unbounded, or it reaches the boundary of the domain, or it accumulates at a different solution on the base parameter level. When the component is bounded and stays in the interior, there is a degree balance on the base slice entailing a vanishing sum of local indices and, in particular, the existence of an even number of non-degenerate contact points. For real-analytic maps we construct locally injective parameterizations that exhibit blow-up, approach to the boundary, or return to the base level. An application to a quasilinear boundary value problem driven by the mean-curvature and Minkowski operators illustrates the global results."}

The size of the particles, their distance between each other and the layer's thickness are all of the same order but small compared to the wavelength of the incident wave. Solving the Helmholtz equation in this context can be very costly and the simulation depends on the given distribution of particles. To circumvent this, we propose, via a multi-scale asymptotic expansion of the solution, an effective model where the layer of particles is replaced by an equivalent boundary condition. The coefficients that appear in this equivalent boundary condition depend on the solutions to corrector problems of Laplace type defined on unbounded random domains. Under the assumption that the particles are distributed given a stationary and mixing random point process, we prove that those problems admit a unique solution in the proper space. We then establish quantitative error estimates for the effec tive model and present numerical simulations that illustrate our theoretical results."}

The equations are formulated for components of the Maxwell field relative to the algebraically special frame of Kerr, with the unknowns treated as tensorial quantities associated with a non-integrable horizontal distribution.

Assuming control over the extremal components, we prove uniform boundedness (without loss of derivatives) and decay estimates for the middle components in the full |a|<=M range of spacetime parameters. Our analysis relies on (i) deriving a decoupled system of transport and elliptic equations for two modified middle Maxwell components and (ii) decomposing general solutions into a dynamical and stationary part, the latter determined by two real (electric and magnetic) charges which are entirely read off from the initial data at the event horizon.\n  In the sub-extremal |a|<M case, works of Shlapentokh-Rothman and the second author provide the necessary control over the extremal components, yielding unconditional boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations.\n  In the extremal |a|=M case, we formulate a conjectural boundedness and decay statement for the extremal components, motivated by work of Casals, Gralla and Zimmerman on fixed azimuthal mode solutions compactly supported away from the event horizon.
