The kinetic models of Henry, Langmuir, Frumkin, Volmer and van der Waals are considered. First, treating the Ward-Tordai integral equation as a fractional order one, the partial differential model is transformed into a single fractional ordinary differential equation for the adsorption. A transformation of the obtained equation is proposed that reduces the number of parameters to two dimensionless groups (at Frumkin and van der Waals models a third parameter appears). In the simplest case of Henry adsorption isotherm the fractional differential model depends on a single dimensionless group and an exact solution exists, represented in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions. Based on this solution, second order asymptotes (at small values of the adsorption) are derived for the other models. The asymptotes of the adsorption result in a higher order asymptotes for the surface pressure (surface tension). For small surface coverage, all considered models converge to the Henry model's predictions, making it a universal first-order approximation for the surface tension. Next, the fractional differential model is written as an integral equation %of fractional order that can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Ward-Tordai equation to the case of barrier-diffusion control. For computer simulation of the obtained integral equation a predictor-corrector numerical method is developed and numerical results are presented and discussed."}

In contrast, for the autonomous case ($α=0$), Appolloni \\& Molle (2025) and Zhang \\& Zhang (2022) showed that potential mountain pass solutions share the same energy levels as in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, causing non-existence due to energy leakage to infinity. This work demonstrates that the physically motivated decaying term $|x|^{-α}$ breaks the scaling symmetry inherent in the autonomous case. Such breaking energetically separates the exterior domain problem from the whole space one and thereby prevents energy leakage. Using a novel min-max argument that combines monotonicity trick, Morse index estimates, and blow-up analysis, we prove the existence of a positive mountain pass solution for sufficiently small mass, revealing a new phenomenon of non-autonomous nonlinearities in non-compact domains."}

In this paper, we investigate the singular limit of the system in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\\ge2$) when the relaxation parameter $\\varepsilon>0$ tends to zero. In contrast to the Euler system with velocity damping, the E-NS model features only a weaker relaxation of the relative velocity, which makes it challenging to analyze its dynamics as $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0$. We develop an energy argument to show global-in-time error estimates between the E-NS system and its limit system, the so-called Kramers-Smoluchowski-Navier-Stokes (KS-NS) system. These error estimates enable us to prove the global existence and uniform-in-$\\varepsilon$ regularity of the strong solution to the E-NS system in a hybrid critical Besov space with a sharp frequency threshold of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ separating the low- and high-frequency regimes. Moreover, the large-time asymptotic stability of the global solution to the E-NS system is established. More precisely, we derive the optimal decay rates of the solution uniformly in $\\varepsilon$, and the enhanced decay rates for the difference between the densities of the E-NS system and the KS-NS system."}

We next focus on $K$-biinvariant initial data for certain special cases of rank $1$, depending on geometric and topological considerations, and prove that the sufficiency of the regularity threshold can be improved down to $α>1/3$, whereas the phenomenon fails for $α<1/4$ for the Schrödinger equation. We also obtain the same results for other dispersive equations: the Boussinesq equation and the Beam equation, also known as the fourth order Wave equation, by a novel transference principle, which seems to be new even for the circle $\\mathbb{T} \\cong SO(2)$ and may be of independent interest. Our arguments involve harmonic analysis arising from the representation theory of compact semi-simple Lie groups and also number theory."}

Introducing the class of finite energy weak solutions for the initial-boundary value problem corresponding to the relaxation model in spatial dimension three, we show that the weak-strong uniqueness principle holds.

The fluid is thereby governed by the non necessarily isentropic compressible Euler equations, while the rigid body obeys the conservation of linear and angular momentum. This forms a coupled system comprising an ODE and the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) of a hyperbolic system with characteristic boundary in a moving domain, where the fluid velocity matches the solid velocity along the normal direction of the solid boundary. We establish the existence of a unique local classical solution to this coupled system. To construct the solution, we first perform a change of variables to reformulate the problem in a fixed spatial domain, and then analyze an approximate system with a non-characteristic boundary. For this nonlinear approximate system, we use the better regularity for the trace of the pressure on the boundary to contruct a solution by a fixed-point argument in which the fluid motion and the solid motion are updated in successive steps. We are then able to derive estimates independent of the regularization parameter and to pass to the limit by a strong compactness arguments."}
