In contrast with the melting problem, physical experiments and heuristics indicate that the water--ice interface in the supercooled problem may exhibit fractal freezing sets, infinite-speed propagation of the frozen front, and nucleation (the spontaneous appearance of ice). Despite this, we show that the free boundary has a robust structure.\n  We decompose the free boundary into three parts: (1) a regular part that advances with finite speed in time; (2) a singular part consisting of points where the front attains infinite speed or nucleates, but with controlled space-time (i.e., $\\leq d-1$ parabolic) dimension; and (3) a jump component, which can have large dimension in a time slice, but which is contained in a space-time smooth graph and occurs only at a zero-dimensional set of times. Examples show that each of these parts can be nonempty.\n  Furthermore, we prove that the free boundary is the graph $t=s(x)$ of a continuously differentiable freezing time $s$, and the singular set coincides with the critical set of $s$, proving that singularities in supercooled freezing always occur with infinite speed.\n  These results provide the first free boundary regularity theory for the supercooled Stefan problem in arbitrary dimensions."}

First, we study general solutions and their irregularities, showing generic fractal freezing and nucleation, based on a novel Markovian gluing principle. In contrast, we then establish regularity properties of maximal solutions, which are obtained by maximizing a suitable notion of \"average\" freezing time. Unexpectedly, we show that maximal solutions have a transition zone that is open modulo a low-dimensional set: this allows us to apply obstacle problem theory for a finer regularity analysis. We further show that maximal solutions are in general non-universal, and we obtain sharp stability results under perturbation of each maximal solution. Lastly, we study maximal solutions in both the radial and the one-dimensional setting. We show that in these cases the maximal solution is universal and minimizes nucleation, in agreement with phenomena observed in the physics literature."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We establish an almost-monotonicity formula for a parabolic frequency on Gaussian spaces for solutions of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck heat equation with lower-order terms: $$\\partial_t u = L_γu + b(x,t) \\cdot \\nabla u + c(x,t)u, $$ where $L_γ= Δ- x \\cdot \\nabla$ is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator. In contrast to classical results that require $b$ and $c$ to be bounded, we only assume that $b$ is bounded and $c$ satisfies a linear growth condition, while the solution $u$ is allowed to have at most exponential quadratic growth. The key innovation is a weighted $L^2$ framework that uses the backward Mehler kernel as a weight, which naturally encodes the underlying measure and compensates for the unbounded coefficients. From the frequency monotonicity, we derive the strong unique continuation principle. This extends Poon's seminal results and complements recent geometric generalizations by Colding and Minicozzi in the context of Gaussian measure spaces. We further apply our framework to establish unique continuation for equations with potentials exhibiting quadratic growth or certain singularities."}

This phenomenon has been recognized since the nineteenth century, e.g., in the classical works of O. Reynolds [Nature, 1876] and O. Lodge [Lond. Edinb. Dubl. Phil. Mag., 1885], yet rigorous mathematical definitions and proofs have remained largely undeveloped, with most subsequent studies relying on thin-core approximations or asymptotic analyses. In this paper, we give a rigorous definition of a vortex atmosphere and establish its existence and uniqueness. We further compare the planar atmosphere surrounding a 2D vortex dipole with the axisymmetric atmosphere surrounding a 3D vortex ring. In particular, we emphasize and prove the topological distinctions observed by W. Hicks [Lond. Edinb. Dubl. Phil. Mag., 1919]: under natural assumptions, every 2D dipole with its atmosphere forms an oval-shaped region, whereas for 3D rings, both spheroidal and toroidal configurations may occur. Our proof is based on showing that each atmosphere can be characterized precisely as a specific superlevel set of its corresponding stream function."}

For all dimensions $n\\ge 2$ and all exponents $p>1$, we prove the existence of normalized solutions whose $L^2$-mass concentrates on spheres with radii diverging to infinity. In particular, the concentration set escapes to infinity rather than remaining on a fixed compact hypersurface, which makes our regime qualitatively different both from classical point-concentration phenomena and from concentrating profiles in unconstrained problems. Our approach combines a tailored finite-dimensional reduction with a blow-up analysis based on Pohozaev identities and, in this way, extends the two-dimensional mass-critical result for $(n,p)=(2,3)$ obtained in Guo--Tian--Zhou (Calc.\\ Var.\\ Partial Differential Equations, 2022). The proof in that paper relies in an essential way on the two-dimensional structure and does not directly apply in higher dimensions, whereas here we develop a different approximation scheme and functional setting adapted to the high-dimensional sphere-at-infinity concentration regime."}

We investigate their behaviors at both endpoint powers of the nonlinearity, up to some rescaling to infer non-trivial limits. One case corresponds to the limit towards a Gaussian function called Gausson, which is the ground state of the stationary logarithmic Schr{ö}dinger equation. The other case, for dimension at least three, corresponds to the limit towards the Aubin-Talenti algebraic soliton. We prove strong convergence with explicit bounds for both cases, and provide detailed asymptotics. These theoretical results are illustrated with numerical approximations."}

We prove that the free-energy of the interacting Bose gas (counted relatively to the non-interacting one) converges to the free energy of the $Φ^4\\_2$ non-linear Schr{ö}dinger-Gibbs measure, thereby revisiting recent results and streamlining proofs thereof. We combine the variational method of Lewin-Nam-Rougerie to connect, with controled error, the quantum free energy to a classical Hartree-Gibbs one with smeared non-linearity.
