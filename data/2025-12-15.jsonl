Notwithstanding a number of recent examples, the uniqueness of such reconstructions has not yet been clearly established. In this paper, we examine the underlying inverse problem in detail and construct explicit counterexamples demonstrating non-uniqueness for a recent implementation of x-ray eigenstrain tomography involving reconstruction from a single measured component of strain. We follow on to explore minimum conditions for well-posedness and conclude that the full elastic strain tensor within an isotropic sample can be uniquely reconstructed from three measured components; specifically the three shear components, or the three diagonal components. We further prove two key results related to eigenstrain reconstruction in a general sense; 1. That any possible residual stress field can be generated by a diagonal eigenstrain and 2. That residual stress fields exist that cannot be generated by isotropic eigenstrains. Together, these findings establish rigorous minimum experimental and computational requirements for well-posed eigenstrain tomography techniques and inverse eigenstrain problems in general."}

This means that the distribution of agents appears in the Hamiltonian only in an integral over the whole spatial domain. For mean field games with a class of such Hamiltonians, we prove existence of solutions for the mean field games system of partial differential equations, allowing pseudomeasure data for the distribution of agents. Specifically, this allows the initial distribution of agents to be a sum of Dirac masses. The existence theorem requires a smallness condition on the size of the terminal data for the value function (or, alternatively, on the size of the Hamiltonian); no smallness condition on the size of the initial data or on the size of the time horizon is required. We also prove uniqueness and continuous dependence results under the same type of smallness conditions. We prove continuous dependence under two complementary hypotheses on the initial data: strong convergence of a sequence of pseudomeasures, and weak-$*$ convergence of a sequence of bounded measures."}

It is challenging to establish the inviscid limit over large time periods for the incompressible Euler equations under the influence of the weak dissipative mechanism generated by the friction force. We first prove the global stability of the equilibrium, in the sense that initial perturbations with appropriate Besov spatial regularity lead to global well-posedness and uniform regularity estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficient for strong solutions of the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations. In particular, we establish the optimal rates of convergence to equilibrium uniformly in Navier-Stokes. Then, we construct global solutions to the inhomogeneous Euler-Fokker-Planck equations via the vanishing viscosity limit. Furthermore, by capturing the dissipation arising from two-phase interactions, we rigorously justify the global-in-time strong convergence of the inviscid limit process, with a convergence rate that is in sharp contrast to that in the pure incompressible fluid case. To achieve this global convergence, novel ideas and new techniques are developed in the analysis and may be applied to other significant problems."}

The principal symbol in this calculus involves the unitary representations of a family of graded nilpotent groups. Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone. As a byproduct, we show that the C*-algebra of principal symbols and the one of pseudodifferential operators of order 0 are solvable with explicit subquotients."}

These stationary profiles connect the non-degenerate equilibrium point with the degenerate state at zero, they are monotone, and arrive to the degenerate state at a finite point. They are neither sharp nor smooth. The degeneracy of the diffusion precludes the application of standard techniques to locate the essential spectrum of the linearized operator around the wave in the energy space $L^2$. This difficulty is overcome with a suitable partition of the spectrum, the analysis of singular sequences, a generalized convergence of operators technique and refined energy estimates. It is shown that the $L^2$-spectrum of the linearized operator around the front is real and with a spectral gap, that is, a positive distance between the imaginary axis and the rest of the spectrum, with the exception of the origin. Moreover, the origin is a simple isolated eigenvalue, associated to the derivative of the profile as eigenfunction (the translation eigenvalue). Finally, it is shown that the linearization generates an analytic semigroup that decays exponentially outside a one-dimensional eigenspace associated to the zero eigenvalue."}
