Keywords: elasticity, microstructure, incompatible, two-well problems, scaling laws", "summary": "In this article, we study scaling laws for singularly perturbed two-well energies with prescribed Dirichlet boundary data in settings where the wells and/or the boundary data are incompatible. Our main focus is the geometrically linear two-well problem, for which we characterize the energy scaling in two dimensions for nearly all combinations of linear boundary data and stress-free strains. In particular, we prove that if the boundary data enforces oscillations and the weight $ε$ of the surface energy is small, the minimal energy upon subtracting the zeroth-order contribution scales either as $ε^{{4}/{5}}$ or as $ε^{{2}/{3}}$, depending on whether the wells differ by a rank-one or a rank-two matrix, respectively. For the gradient and divergence-free two-well problem, we obtain analogous results, showing an $ε^{{2}/{3}}$-scaling behavior in two dimensions whenever oscillations are energetically favored. These results follow by deriving matching upper and lower scaling bounds. The lower scaling bounds are established in a general $\\mathcal{A}$-free framework for incompatible two-well problems, which allows us to compute the excess energy and characterize boundary data which enforce oscillations. The upper scaling bounds are obtained by branching constructions which are adapted to the incompatible setting."}

We derive potentially non-perturbative series expansions in $δ$ that provide a process to obtain the solution of the nonlinear PDE through solving a hierarchical system of linear, forced PDEs with the forcing terms dependent on solutions at lower orders in the hierarchy. We rigorously detail our approach for a particular deformation that interpolates between linear advection-diffusion and the canonical Burgers' equation modeling nonlinear advection. In this case, we prove that the series has infinite radius of convergence for arbitrary integrable initial data, analyze the cases of a Dirac-delta initial condition (IC) (i.e., the fundamental solution) in an infinite domain and arbitrary IC in a periodic domain, and demonstrate the approach to turbulent behavior in a scenario with periodic forcing. We then treat models of nonlinear diffusion involving the $p$-Laplacian operator, including generalizations of the Poisson equation in $1$ and $2$ dimensions, and the heat equation in $1+1$ dimensions. We detail series expansions for two different deformations of these equations about their linear (ordinary Laplacian) counterparts, providing numerical evidence for the convergence of the series outside of a perturbative regime and demonstrating that the rate and radius of convergence are affected by choice of deformation. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for using series expansion techniques to study nonlinear advection-diffusion PDEs, opening new pathways for analysis and potential applications for quantum-assisted computational fluid dynamics."}

Our primary focus is on examining the asymptotic behaviors of the principal eigenvalue with respect to large advection and small or large diffusion rates. We subsequently apply these results to a nonlinear age-structured model, providing a better understanding of how diffusion and advection influence the spatial distribution of species. Among other ingredients, our approach involves constructing various types of super- and sub-solutions to tackle the novel challenges posed by the nonlocal terms in the problems under consideration."}

Our study has two main objectives: first, to analyze the generic regularity of global conservative solutions; and second, to construct a new metric that guarantees the Lipschitz continuity of the flow. Building on the geometric framework developed by Bressan and Chen for quasilinear second-order wave equations, we prove that the solution retains $C^k$ regularity away from a finite number of piecewise $C^{k-1}$ characteristic curves. Furthermore, we provide a description of the solution behavior in the vicinity of these curves. By introducing a Finsler norm on tangent vectors in the space of solutions, expressed in the transformed Bressan-Constantin variables, we introduce a Lipschitz metric representing the minimal energy transportation cost between two solutions."}

Simas"], "title": "Fractional and Integer Order Sobolev Spaces for Compact Metric Graphs", "comment": "41 pages", "summary": "Given a compact metric graph $Γ$ and the Laplacian $Δ_Γ$ coupled with standard (Kirchhoff) vertex conditions, solutions to fractional elliptic partial differential equations of the form $(κ^2 - Δ_Γ)^{α/2}u=f$ on $Γ$ exhibit a distinctive regularity structure: even-order derivatives are continuous across vertices, while odd-order derivatives may be discontinuous. This non-standard smoothness property precludes the direct application of classical tools from real functional analysis. Because of this, we introduce and systematically study new families of Sobolev spaces tailored to this setting. We define these spaces, denoted $W^{α,p}(Γ)$ and $H^α(Γ)$, to respect the continuity constraints on even-order derivatives at vertices, while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. We establish their fundamental properties, including characterizations, embedding theorems into Hölder and Lebesgue spaces, and compactness results. A central contribution in this investigation is the derivation of uniform bounds on the supremum norm of eigenfunctions for a class of Laplacians on metric graphs, a result of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs driven by Gaussian white noise on metric graphs, in particular, establishing a general characterization of the domain of the fractional powers of $(κ^2-Δ_Γ)$ and $(κ^2-\\nabla(a\\nabla))$ in terms of the Sobolev spaces we introduce, thereby extending all previously known characterizations in the literature, and improving the regularity results previously obtained to their sharp counterparts (with general fractional powers). We also show that these spaces are fundamental to the characterization of Gaussian free fields on metric graphs."}

In this work we focus on the heat equation on a finite interval and we determine the dimensionless diffusion parameter from a single measurement. Our results extend to estimating additional parameters of the initial-boundary value problem, such as the length of the interval and/or the time required for the solution to achieve a specific state. Our approach relies on the asymptotic solution of an integral equation: The formulation of this integral equation is based on the solution of the direct problem via the Fokas method; the solution of this equation is achieved through the asymptotic evaluation of the associated integrals which yield an effective approximate solution, supported by numerical verifications. We apply these approximations to well-established problems in soil science and we compare our results with existing ones, displaying clear improvement."}
