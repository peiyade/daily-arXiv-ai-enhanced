The fluid flow is of {F}orchheimer-type and is subject to a mixed mass and volumetric flux boundary condition. The governing equations are reduced to a nonlinear partial differential equation for the pseudo-pressure. This parabolic-typed equation can be degenerate and/or singular in the spatial variables, the unknown and its gradient. We establish the $L^α$-estimate for the solutions, for any positive number $α$, in terms of the initial and boundary data and the angular speed of rotation. It requires new elliptic and parabolic Sobolev inequalities and trace theorem with multiple weights that are suitable to the nonlinear structure of the equation. The $L^\\infty$-estimate is then obtained without imposing any conditions on the $L^\\infty$-norms of the weights and the initial and boundary data."}

This condition, introduced in (Djoko {\\it et al.} {\\it Comput. Math. Appl.} 128 (2022) 198--213), represents a generalization of the Navier slip boundary condition. The goal is to study the influence of the power law slip boundary conditions with an anisotropic tensor of order $\\ep^{γ\\over s}$, with $γ\\in \\mathbb{R}$ and flow index $1<s<2$, on the behavior of the fluid with thickness $\\ep$ by using asymptotic analysis when $\\ep\\to 0$, depending on the values of $γ$. As a result, we deduce the existence of a critical value of $γ$ given by $γ_s^*=3-2s$ and so, three different limit boundary conditions are derived. The critical case $γ=γ_s^*$ corresponds to a limit condition of type power law slip. The supercritical case $γ>γ_s^*$ corresponds to a limit boundary condition of type perfect slip. The subcritical case $γ<γ_s^*$ corresponds to a limit boundary condition of type no-slip."}

Our approach provides an optimal convergence rate.\n  We also present some results of independent interest. These include existence theorems for the first-order equation, obtained through an appropriate Hopf-Lax representation, and a useful description of the action of the idiosyncratic operator on geodesically convex functions."}
