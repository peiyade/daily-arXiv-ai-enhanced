This seems to be the first result on $[0,τ]$ for arbitrary $τ> 0$ for a model coupling moisture dynamics to heat-conducting, compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A key feature of the micro-physics model is that it also includes phase changes of water in moist air. These phase changes are associated with large amounts of latent heat and thus result in a strong coupling to the thermodynamic equation. The well-posedness results are obtained by means of a Lagrangian approach, which allows to treat the hyperbolicity in the continuity equation. More precisely, optimal $\\mathrm{L}^p$-$\\mathrm{L}^q$ estimates are shown for the linearized system, leading to the local well-posedness result by a fixed point argument and suitable nonlinear estimates.

Since then, for the two-dimensional viscous or inviscid shallow water equations, the global existence of smooth solutions with arbitrarily large initial data has remained a challenging and long-standing open problem. In this paper, we provide an affirmative resolution to the viscous problem under the assumption of two-dimensional radial symmetry. Specifically, we establish the global existence of smooth solutions for the two-dimensional radially symmetric viscous shallow water equations with arbitrary smooth initial data. To achieve this goal, our approach relies crucially on overcoming two major obstacles: first, treating the viscous Saint-Venant system as the endpoint case of the BD entropy condition for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations; and second, addressing the critical embedding imposed by the spatial dimension, which currently holds only in two dimensions. However, the same result can be extended to three dimension for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying general BD entropy conditions excluding the endpoint case. Indeed, under the same symmtric framework, we also prove the global existence of smooth solutions for arbitrarily large initial data for both the two- and three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to the BD entropy condition. It is particularly noteworthy that the aforementioned shallow water equations precisely correspond to the endpoint case of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy condition."}

The flow exhibits a strong interplay between vortex stretching, shearing, and mixing, which generates ever-smaller spatial scales and thereby significantly amplifies viscous effects. By adopting an anisotropic self-similar coordinate system adapted to the filament geometry, we establish the nonlinear asymptotic stability of the Oseen vortex filament. All non-axisymmetric perturbations are shown to decay at the optimal rate $t^{-κ|α|^{1/2}}$. At the linear level, this decay mechanism corresponds to a sharp spectral lower bound $Σ(α) \\sim |α|^{1/2}$ for the nonlocal Oseen operator $L_\\perp - αΛ_\\perp$, and we identify an explicit spectral point attaining this optimal bound. Combined with the spectral estimates obtained in \\cite{LWZ}, our analysis fully resolves the conjecture proposed in \\cite{GM} concerning the asymptotic scaling laws for the spectral and pseudospectral bounds $Σ(α)$ and $Ψ(α)$.

We establish two main results: the existence of energy-dissipating solutions, and the uniqueness and continuous dependence on initial data. The proposed framework yields a general well-posedness theory for a broad class of nonlinear evolutionary systems driven by state-dependent operators.

The frequent emergence of such diseases highlight the need for integrated frameworks that capture both individual-level infection kinetics and between-host transmission. While analytical models for each scale exist, tractable approaches that link them remain limited. In this study, we present a novel multiscale mathematical framework that integrates within-host infection kinetics with airborne transmission dynamics. The model represents each host as a patch and couples a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing in-host infection kinetics with a diffusion-based partial differential equation (PDE) for airborne pathogen movement in enclosed spaces. These scales are linked through boundary conditions on each patch boundary, representing viral shedding and inhalation. Using matched asymptotic analysis in the regime of intermediate diffusivity, we derived a nonlinear ODE model from the coupled ODE-PDE system that retains spatial heterogeneity through Neumann Green's functions. We established the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of solutions to the reduced model and analyzed within-host infection kinetics as functions of the airborne pathogen diffusion rate and host spatial configuration. In the well-mixed limit, the model recovers the classical target cell limited viral dynamics framework. Overall, the proposed multiscale modeling approach enables the simultaneous study of transient within-host infection dynamics and population-level disease spread, providing a tractable yet biologically grounded framework for investigating airborne disease transmission in indoor environments."}

The effective model consists of a deterministic part for the fluid's hydrodynamic quantities and a kinetic equation for the limit Young measure encoding the mixing dynamics. By characterizing the Young measure with the corresponding cumulative distribution function, we rewrite the kinetic equation for the Young measure into a kinetic equation for the cumulative distribution function such that the resulting equations are accessible by standard approximation methods."}

The situation is less clear in the time domain, where recent works suggest the presence of an additional temporal scale that quantifies the smallness of the obstacle. In this paper we argue that this is not necessarily the case, and that it is possible to construct asymptotic models with an error that does not deteriorate in time, at least in the case of a sound-soft scattering problem by a star-shaped obstacle in 3D."}

We establish basic properties of this notion of solution and show that it coincides with the Perron solution. Variational solutions can elegantly be characterised in terms of the given boundary function when the variational solution has finite energy. However, it is impossible to decide in terms of the regularity of the given boundary function when a classical solution exists. We demonstrate this by analysing Lebesgue's cusp, and more precisely Lebesgue's domain which is associated with the potential of a thin rod with mass density going to zero at one end. We also show that the non-continuity of the Perron solution at a singular point is a generic and non-local property."}
