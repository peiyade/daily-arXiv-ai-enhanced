This work is based on the careful implementation of the pioneering Fokas unified transform methodology alongside its recently-proposed extension for solving a class of linear evolution equations with dispersion relation of specific polynomial type and time-dependent coefficients. We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case. The new formulas are of utility in subsequent investigation of qualitative properties and analysis of nonlinear counterparts too. Further extensions, generalizations, rigorous aspects and implementations to other types of problems as well will soon be reported in forthcoming publications."}

Welcome all comments!", "summary": "In this article, we initiate the study of the Cauchy problem for the two-dimensional relativistic Euler equations in a low-regularity setting. By introducing good variables--a rescaled velocity, logarithmic enthalpy, and an appropriately defined vorticity, we reformulate the equations into a coupled wave-transport system.\n  First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions when the initial logarithmic enthalpy $h_0$, rescaled velocity $\\bv_0$, and vorticity $\\bw_0$ satisfy $(h_0, \\bv_0, \\bw_0, \\nabla \\bw_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac32+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times L^8(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. By using Strichartz estimates and semiclassical analysis, a relaxed well-posedness result holds when $(h_0, \\bv_0, \\bw_0, \\nabla \\bw_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac32}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times L^8(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. Both results are valid for the general state function $p(\\varrho)=\\varrho^A$ ($A \\geq 1$).\n  Secondly, in the special case where $p(\\varrho)=\\varrho$, the acoustic metric reduces to the standard flat Minkowski metric. We can establish the well-posedness of solutions when $(h_0, \\mathbf{v}_0, \\mathbf{w}_0) \\in H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{\\frac{7}{4}+}(\\mathbb{R}^2) \\times H^{1+}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$. The regularity exponents for the log-enthalpy and rescaled velocity correspond to those in Smith and Tataru \\cite{ST}, while the vorticity regularity corresponds to Bourgain and Li \\cite{BL}. Moreover, if the stiff flow is irrotational, we can prove the local well-posedness for $(h_0, \\mathbf{v}_0) \\in H^{1+}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, and global well-posedness for small initial data $(h_0, \\bv_0) \\in \\dot{B}^{1}_{2,1}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$."}
