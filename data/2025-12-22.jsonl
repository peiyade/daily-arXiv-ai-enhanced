We show that in the no-slip limit three fundamentally different classes of limiting solutions are approached, each of them corresponding to a different scaling of the microscopic contact angle as the regularization parameter vanishes.

An additive decomposition of the strain rate into elastic and inelastic parts leads to an evolution equation for the small elastic strain, which is coupled with an adapted momentum equation. As plasticity is modeled through a non-smooth dissipation potential, we introduce a weak formulation in terms of a variational inequality.

In this way, we rigorously confirm a conjecture on phase separation originating in the physics and applied literature. Our sharp and quantitative (in)stability results are valid both in the non-diffusive case and in the case of small angular diffusion. In the stable non-diffusive regime, we uncover a mixing mechanism reminiscent of Landau damping for the Vlasov equation, albeit with significantly weaker decay.
