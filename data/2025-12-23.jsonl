By a suitable rescaling of the magnetic pressure in terms of some parameter $\\varepsilon>0$, by letting $\\varepsilon\\to 0$ we perform the incompressible limit while keeping the Mach number of order $O(1)$.\n  The study is conducted in the framework of global in time finite energy weak solutions and for ill-prepared initial data. We also consider a similar problem in presence of a strong Coriolis term. The key ingredient of the proof, based on a compensated compactness argument, is the use of the transport equation (well-known in the context of two-fluid models) underlying the dynamics. Thanks to it, and differently from previous studies about the incompressible limit, we are able to identify the asymptotics of the terms of order $O(\\varepsilon)$ and to characterise their dynamics; such an information is in fact crucial to obtain a closed system in the limit."}

A formidable challenge lies in how the well-known coordinate singularity at the origin can be overcome to control the lower or upper bound of the density. For the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with constant viscosity coefficients, recent striking results have shown that such implosions do indeed occur. In this paper, we show that the situation is fundamentally different when the viscosity coefficients are degenerately density-dependent (as in the shallow water equations). We prove that, for general large spherically symmetric initial data with bounded positive density, solutions remain globally regular and cannot undergo cavitation or implosion in two and three spatial dimensions. Our results hold for all adiabatic exponents $γ\\in (1,\\infty)$ in two dimensions, and for physical adiabatic exponents $γ\\in (1, 3)$ in three dimensions, without any restriction on the size of the initial data. To achieve these results, we make carefully designed weighted radial estimates via a region segmentation method, which is the key for obtaining uniform control over both the density and the effective velocity.

Here, 'nonlocal' means that the velocity of the conservation law depends on an integral term in space. Typically, the nonlocal term consists of integrating the solution in $L^{1}$, whereas here we will study the case when the solution is integrated in the $L^{p}$-norm. We consider even the case of the $L^{p}$ metric when $p\\in (0,1)$ and establish, for an initial datum which is uniformly bounded away from zero, the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. We then demonstrate that there are also solutions to the initial datum being zero under more restrictive assumptions. Furthermore, we investigate the singular limit, i.e., what happens when the nonlocal kernel converges to a Dirac distribution. Indeed, for the one-sided exponential kernel, we recover the (entropy) solution of the corresponding local conservation law for all $p\\in(0,\\infty)$ with further restrictions for $p\\in(0,1)$. This generalizes the celebrated singular limit result for nonlocal conservation laws for $p=1$ significantly and showcases the robustness of the approximation of local conservation laws by nonlocal ones.

Finally, we prove the convergence of solutions for $p\\rightarrow 0$ on a small time horizon, resulting in a different kind of nonlocal conservation law.

We first establish the local well-posedness of strong solutions for bounded domains and study the mechanism of finite-time singularity formation in the 2D radially symmetric case and 3D cylindrically symmetric case. We prove that if the initial density vanishes in an interior region containing the origin and the magnetic field is non-trivial within this vacuum region, the strong solution must blow up in finite time. These results generalize and improve the previous results of Huang-Xin-Yan [Math. Ann. 392 (2025) 2365-2394] for the compressible isentropic MHD equations.

This result was subsequently extended and refined to accommodate more general constraints on the viscosity coefficients. However, because the proofs in this line of work [17,14,15,8] rely heavily on the structure of the isentropic equations, they could not be generalized to the broader setting of multidimensional compressible heat-conductive Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems. In this paper, we consider a special class of non-isentropic compressible fluids governed by the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable entropy. In this system, the pressure depends nonlinearly on both density and entropy, and the entropy evolves solely through a transport equation-a feature that distinguishes it from the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier model. We establish, for the first time, the global existence of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data on both two-dimensional periodic domains and bounded domains endowed with Navier-slip boundary conditions. For the bounded-domain case, a key step in our analysis is the derivation of new commutator estimates compatible with the slip condition. Our results hold even when the initial density may contain vacuum and require no smallness assumption on the initial data, provided the shear viscosity is constant and the bulk viscosity follows a power-law form $λ(ρ)=ρ^β$ with $β> 4/3$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the density remains uniformly bounded for all time. Consequently, the solution converges to an equilibrium state as time tends to infinity."}

The expansion of the spatial sections introduces an additional dissipating effect in the Euler equation. We prescribe the expansion rate of space by a scale factor $a(t)=t^α$ with $α\\in(0,1)$, which describes the growth of length scales over time. This model is regularly applied in cosmology to study classical fluids in an expanding Universe. We study the behaviour of solutions to this system arising from small, near-homogeneous initial data and discover a \\emph{critical} change of behaviour near the expansion rate $α=2/3$, which corresponds to the matter-dominated regime in cosmology. In particular, we prove that for $α>2/3$ the fluid variables are global in time and remain small provided they are sufficiently small in a suitable norm initially. In the complementary regime $α\\leq2/3$, we present numerical evidence for shock formation of solutions to the Euler equation for arbitrarily small initial data. In combination, this establishes the existence of a critical stability threshold for barotropic fluids in expanding domains. In contrast to our previous work on the corresponding relativistic system, the threshold in the classical system considered here is independent of the speed of sound of the fluid. This establishes that fluids in cosmology behave fundamentally different in the non-relativistic regime than in the relativistic one."}
