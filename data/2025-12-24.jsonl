The equation under consideration is a nonlocal analog of the classical prescribed Gaussian curvature equation. A concentration-compactness alternative is established for sequences of solutions to the equation under consideration whenever suitable integrability assumptions on the solutions and the curvature functions are satisfied. Under further regularity assumptions on the curvature functions, and when blow-up occurs in the concentration-compactness alternative, an energy quantization result is established."}

All comments are welcome", "summary": "In this paper, we investigate the existence of 2-D Taylor-Couette flow for a rarefied gas between two coaxial rotating cylinders, characterized by differing angular velocities at the outer boundary $\\{r=1\\}$ and the inner boundary $\\{r=r_{1}>0\\}$, with a small relative strength denoted by $α$. We formulate the problem using the steady Boltzmann equation in polar coordinates and seek a solution invariant under rotation. We assume that the steady state has the specific form $F(r,v_{r},v_φ-α\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}},v_{z})$, where the translation angular velocity $α\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}}$ is linearly sheared along the radial direction. With this ansatz, the problem is reduced to solve the nonlinear steady Boltzmann equation with geometric correction, subject to an external shear force of strength $α$ and the homogeneous non-moving diffuse reflection boundary condition. We establish the existence of a non-equilibrium steady solution for any small enough shear rate $α$ through Caflisch's decomposition, complemented by careful uniform estimates based on Guo's $L^{\\infty} \\cap L^2$ framework. The steady profile displays a polynomial tail behavior at large velocities. For the proof, we develop a delicate double-parameter $(ε,σ)$-approximation argument for the construction of solutions. In particular, we obtain uniform macroscopic dissipation estimates in the absence of mass conservation for $σ\\in [0,1)$ getting close to 1. Additionally, due to the non-trivial geometric effects, we develop subtle constructions of test functions by solving second-order ODEs with geometric corrections to establish macroscopic dissipation. Furthermore, we justify the non-negativity of the steady profile by demonstrating its large-time asymptotic stability with an exponential convergence rate under radial perturbations."}

The approach, inspired by the so-called $L^2$-hypocoercivity method, is robust enough to provide estimates that are uniform in the anomalous diffusion limit. Moreover, it is able to deal with bounded domains with periodic boundary condition or general Maxwell boundary condition (from the pure specular to the pure diffusive case). In addition, our framework accommodates linear collisional operators that act simultaneously on the velocity and spatial variables."}

In contrast to the ideal gas setting, the non-ideal pressure law introduces stronger nonlinear effects and modifies the degeneracy structure near sonic states, which significantly complicates the analytical treatment of transonic flows. Within the self-similar framework associated with the four-state Riemann problem, we construct a supersonic sonic patch solution that connects a strictly supersonic region to a sonic boundary along a pseudo streamline. The analysis is based on a characteristic decomposition combined with a partial hodograph transformation, through which the problem is reformulated as a degenerate hyperbolic system. We establish the existence of a globally defined supersonic solution and prove its uniform regularity up to the sonic curve. In addition, we investigate the regularity properties of the resulting sonic boundary. Our results extend the theory of supersonic sonic patches from polytropic gases to a realistic non-ideal gas model."}

It is shown that both the semilinear Signorini problem and the elastic obstacle problem with normal compliance exhibit exponential decay to zero and admit compact global attractors.
