They arise from context of hydrodynamic limit of N-particle deterministic action minimizing (global) Lagrangian dynamics.\n  From a Lagrangian point of view, this can also be viewed as a limit result on two scale convergence of action minimizing probability-measure-valued paths. However, we focus on the Hamiltonian formulation here mostly. We derive and study convergence of the associated abstract but scalar Hamilton-Jacobi equations, defined in space of probability measures. There is an infinite dimensional singular averaging structure within these equations. We develop an indirect variational approach to apply finite dimensional weak K.A.M. theory to such infinite dimensional setting here. With a weakly interacting particle assumption, the averaging step only involves that of individual particles, which is implicitly but rigorously treated using the weak K.A.M. theory. Consequently, we can close the above mentioned averaging step by identifying limiting Hamiltonian, and arrive at a rigorous convergence result on solutions of the nonlinear PDEs in space of probability measures.\n  In technical development parts of the paper, we devise new viscosity solution techniques regarding projection of equations with a submetry structure in state space, multi-scale convergence for certain abstract Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces, as well as comparison principles for equations in space of probability measures. The space of probability measure we consider is a special case of Alexandrov metric space with curvature bounded from below. Since some results are better explained in such metric space setting, we also develop some techniques in the general settings which are of independent interests."}

Notably, the leading coefficients are merely required to be sufficiently small in BMO, which is strictly weaker than the VMO condition. In the complex setting, the well-posedness of this problem was recently investigated in [W. Kim, M. Vestberg, Existence, uniqueness and regularity for elliptic $p$-Laplace systems with complex coefficients,arXiv:2503.18932], where the authors established a strong accretivity condition on the leading coefficients, and this structural condition allows them to derive Schauder-type estimates for weak solutions. In our study, it has already been observed that gaining existence and uniqueness of weak solutions is possible under a natural and less restrictive assumption on the complex-valued coefficients. Following this direction, we prove a global Caderón-Zygmund-type estimate for weak solutions, from which the Morrey-space regularity follows as a consequence. This paper is a contribution to the better understanding of solution behavior and may be viewed as part of a series of works aimed at extending regularity theory in the complex-valued setting."}

First, in the setting of semilinear elliptic PDEs, we introduce a refined variational truncation method that yields infinite sequences of positive as well as negative solutions. Second and most notably, we resolve a long-standing and difficult problem for nonvariational elliptic PDEs with gradient dependence. By combining our truncation method with an iterative scheme, we prove, for the first time, the existence of infinitely many solutions for this class of PDEs. Third, we overcome a central difficulty for periodic Hamiltonian systems on the real line: we show that the multiplicity of solutions, constructed on a sequence of finite intervals, survives in the limit; in other words, no collapse occurs, and we obtain multiple distinct solutions on the whole real line.\n  The core novelty lies in a carefully designed truncation methodology that systematically separates solutions and remains effective across variational and non-variational PDEs as well as infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This unified perspective provides a robust and versatile tool for addressing multiplicity problems in the absence of symmetry."}

A key ingredient of the analysis is a dispersive estimate for the transport flow, which quantifies decay effects generated by spatial propagation. Using this dispersive mechanism, we obtain improved bounds for the nonlinear collision operator and show that small solutions near the vacuum can be propagated on time scales significantly longer than those dictated by conservation laws alone. In particular, dispersion allows one to extend the classical quadratic lifespan to a quartic time scale."}
