London Math. Soc., 2021] on stationary solutions to the singular Keller-Segel system, this paper presents a novel family of explicit steady-state solutions for the same model on a bounded interval, expressed in terms of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions and within a biologically stable parameter regime, these solutions, including singular types such as secant and cosecant, are rigorously derived and analyzed. Their stability is established via energy methods, yielding precise thresholds for pattern persistence. These results provide valuable benchmarks for numerical validation and offer insights into boundary-driven pattern formation."}

In contrast to the flat Euclidean case $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the geometry of $\\mathbb S^2$ imposes new difficulties, and the fluid dynamics are affected by the curved background. To overcome these challenges, we modify the existing modulation method and employ a set of carefully constructed, time-dependent coordinates that precisely track the shock formation on $\\mathbb{S}^2$. In particular, we first perform a time-dependent rotation of $\\mathbb S^2$, then apply the stereographic projection to the sphere, straighten the steepening shock front, and finally construct shock-adapted coordinates. In the shock-adapted coordinates, the compressible Euler equations on $\\mathbb{S}^2$ can be recast into a form suitable for self-similar analysis. Within this framework, we implement a detailed bootstrap argument and establish global well-posedness for the self-similar system. After transferring these results back to the original physical system, we thereby demonstrate the finite-time shock formation on $\\mathbb{S}^2$."}

A key difficulty is that the standard scaling argument, which is important in the classical normalized solution approach, is no longer available in the variable exponent setup. To address this, we work with a constrained variational framework and establish the existence of a ground state solution. We further show that these solutions are $C^{1,α}_{loc}(\\mathbb{R}^N)$.

In this article, we prove large data local well-posedness in low-regularity Sobolev spaces for the skew mean curvature flow in dimension $d\\geq 2$. This is achieved by introducing several new ideas: (i) a time discretization method to establish the existence of smooth solutions, (ii) constructing the orthonormal frame by a parallel transport method and a lifting criterion, (iii) introducing intrinsic fractional function spaces $X^s\\subset H^s$ on a noncompact manifold for any $s>\\frac{d}{2}$, such that the $X^s$-norm of the second fundamental form can be propagated well along the quasilinear Schrödinger flow, (iv) deriving a difference equation to prove the uniqueness result for solutions $F\\in C^2$, which is independent in the choices of gauge.

This paper studies a weighted p-Laplacian eigenvalue problem with Robin boundary conditions on the exterior of the unit ball in Euclidean space of dimension N, with N greater than p. The weight function belongs to a critical Lorentz class and decays at infinity. Under natural assumptions on the weight, we prove the existence, uniqueness, simplicity, and isolation of a positive principal eigenvalue and establish local first-order regularity of the associated eigenfunction. We analyze the dependence of the principal eigenvalue on the Robin parameter and recover the Neumann and Dirichlet limits as the parameter approaches zero and infinity, respectively. The far-field behavior of the eigenfunction exhibits a universal algebraic decay rate that is independent of the Robin parameter, while the near-boundary structure displays an explicit scaling with respect to the parameter. We further investigate the gradient behavior of the eigenfunction, showing the existence of a unique critical radius and providing quantitative bounds on both the critical radius and the boundary value in terms of the Robin parameter. The main contribution of this work is the derivation of unified gradient estimates that connect the near-boundary and far-field regions through a characteristic length scale determined by the Robin parameter, yielding a global description of how boundary effects penetrate into the exterior domain."}

The random potential is assumed to be a generalized Gaussian random function, whose covariance operator is a classical pseudo-differential operator. For the direct problem, the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent of the Schrödinger operator with rough potentials is investigated, which yields the well-posedness of the direct scattering problem and a Born series expansion. For the inverse problem, we derive a probabilistic stability estimate for determining the principle symbol of the covariance operator of the random potential. The stability result provides an estimate of the probability for an event when the principle symbol can be quantitatively determined by a single realization of the multi-frequency backscattered far-field pattern. The analysis employs the ergodicity theory and quantitative analytic continuation principle."}

Our proof is based on the Large Deviations Principle for diffusion processes in random environments, as well as an analysis of the Feynman-Kac formula.
