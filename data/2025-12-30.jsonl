Critical reassessment of conformable derivative as time reparametrization; includes theoretical equivalence proofs, ODE/PDE reformulations, Lorenz system analysis, and numerical comparisons with Caputo derivative", "summary": "The conformable derivative has been promoted in numerous publications as a new fractional derivative operator. This article provides a critical reassessment of this claim. We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena."}

For the two-dimensional initial-boundary value problem, we establish the existence of global finite energy solutions and global weak solutions, using a suitable approximation scheme combined with compactness methods. Next, by carefully analyzing three decoupled subsystems and employing a bootstrap argument, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution for sufficiently regular initial data, as well as the propagation of regularity for global weak solutions.

To achieve these, a stochastic compensated compactness framework in $L^p$ is developed to overcome the difficulty that the uniform $L^{\\infty}$ bound for the stochastic approximate solutions is unavailable, owing to the stochastic forcing term. The convergence of the vanishing viscosity method is established by employing the stochastic compactness framework, along with careful uniform estimates of the stochastic approximate solutions, to obtain the existence of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy. In particular, in the polytropic pressure case for all adiabatic exponents, we prove that the global solutions satisfy the local mechanical energy inequality when the initial data are only required to have finite relative-energy (while the higher moment estimates for entropy are not required here, as needed in the earlier work). Higher-order relative energy estimates for approximate solutions are also derived to establish the entropy inequality for more convex entropy pairs and to then prove the compactness of solutions to the stochastic isentropic Euler system. The stochastic compensated compactness framework and the uniform estimate techniques for approximate solutions developed in this paper should be useful in the study of other similar problems."}

In the present paper, we extend the analysis to the regime of partial wetting, where the surfactant occupies only a portion of the interface. Within the minimizing-movements scheme, we rigorously derive the continuum evolution and show how partial wetting introduces a complex coupling between interfacial motion and redistribution of surfactant. The resulting evolution exhibits new features absent in the fully wetted case, including the coexistence of moving and pinned facets or the emergence and long-lived metastable states.

It captures the nontrivial evolution of effective conductivity, including a characteristic drop reflecting the capacitive behavior of the lipid bilayer, in agreement with experimental data.

The lower bound corresponding to Type I rate is also shown for some particular blow-up solutions. As by products, we present a basic result on classification to threshold solutions for every $p>1+σ/N$."}

An open book is a two-dimensional structure formed by rectangular domains sharing common boundaries. We first develop a functional-analytic framework suited to variational problems on open books and establish the existence of solutions as constrained action minimizers. For graph-based open books (i.e., those isomorphic to the product of a graph with an interval) we prove the existence of a sharp transition in the dimensionality of ground states. Specifically, there exists a critical transverse width: below this threshold, all ground states coincide with the ground states on the underlying graph trivially extended in the transverse direction; above it, ground states become genuinely two-dimensional."}

Then, in this setting, we investigate the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions to nonlinear magnetic Schrödinger equations on compact metric graphs and on noncompact metric graphs with localized nonlinearities or nonlinearities acting on whole metric graphs, covering the mass-subcritical, mass-critical, and mass-supercritical cases."}

Specifically, we demonstrate that for a wide class of Lipschitz domains with asymptotic conical structure, the local positive solutions are well approximated by the positive solutions in the tangent cones at singular boundary points. This extends the results of [10, 12, 26]."}

For this purpose, we introduce a novel class of complementing boundary conditions, extending the classical Lopatinskiĭ-Shapiro conditions from elliptic and parabolic theory to time-periodic mixed-order systems with general boundary conditions. Moreover, we show that the classical Lopatinskiĭ-Shapiro conditions are in general insufficient for well-posedness of mixed-order systems."}
