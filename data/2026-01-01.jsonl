When the system is locally Lipschitz, a solution is ensured to be only locally Lipschitz, but the integral manifolds must be $C^1$. When the system is $C^k$, we can only ensure the existence of a $C^k$ solution, but the integral manifolds must be $C^{k+1}$. In addition, we see a counterexample in which the system is $C^1$, but there is no $C^2$ solution. Moreover, we characterize a minimizer of an optimization problem whose objective function is a quasi-convex solution to a total differential equation.

We derive qualitative local stability estimates in region-wise maximum norms that govern the size of each bump's essential support, confining its core to a designated region and minimizing overlap.

The analysis is performed in a body-fixed reference frame, so that the fluid occupies an exterior domain and the propulsion mechanism is modeled through nonhomogeneous Navier-slip boundary conditions at the fluid-body interface. Such conditions provide a realistic description of propulsion in microfluidic and rough-surface regimes, where partial slip effects are significant. Under suitable smallness assumptions on the boundary flux and on the normal component of the prescribed surface velocity, we establish the existence of weak steady solutions to the coupled fluid-structure system. A key analytical ingredient is the derivation of a Korn-type inequality adapted to exterior domains with rigid-body motion and Navier-slip interfaces, which yields uniform control of both the fluid velocity and the translational and rotational velocities of the body. Beyond existence, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which a prescribed slip velocity on the body surface induces nontrivial translational or rotational motion of the rigid body. This is achieved through the introduction of a finite-dimensional thrust space, defined via auxiliary exterior Stokes problems with Navier boundary conditions, which captures the effective contribution of boundary-driven flows to the rigid-body motion. Our results clarify how boundary effects generate propulsion and extend the classical Dirichlet-based theory to the Navier-slip setting."}

Using exterior calculus, we extend this framework to the full family of convection-diffusion problems posed on $H(\\textbf{grad})$, $H(\\textbf{curl})$, and $H(\\text{div})$. The resulting formulation is based on a 4D Hodge-Laplacian operator with a spatiotemporal diffusion tensor and convection field, augmented by a small temporal perturbation to ensure nondegeneracy. This formulation naturally incorporates fundamental physical constraints, including divergence-free and curl-free conditions. We further introduce an exponentially-fitted 4D spatiotemporal flux operator that symmetrizes the convection-diffusion operator and enables a well-posed variational formulation. Finally, we prove that the temporally-perturbed formulation converges to the original time-dependent convection-diffusion model as the perturbation parameter tends to zero."}

At the same time, [Chen-Zhang-Zhu, http:arXiv:2512.18545, 2025] also independently proved the existence of global large solutions to the Cauchy problem of this system. Notably, in the work of Huang-Meng-Zhang, they also established the existence of global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy equality in both two and three dimensions, and the viscous shallow water equations are precisely a specific class of isentropic compressible fluids subject to the BD entropy equality. In this paper, we prove a new BD entropy inequality for a class of non-isentropic compressible fluids, which can be regarded as a generalization of the shallow water equations with transported entropy. Employing new estimates on the lower bound of density different from that of Huang-Meng-Zhang's work, we show the \"viscous shallow water system with transport entropy\" will admit global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the spherically symmetric initial-boundary value problem in both two and three dimensions.
