The model is endowed with $δ'$--type interaction boundary conditions at the vertex, which enforce continuity of the derivatives of the wave functions, while continuity of the wave function itself is not required. By means of the Implicit Function Theorem, we establish the existence of families of standing--wave profiles that converge, on the circular component of the graph, to Jacobi elliptic solutions of dnoidal type, coupled with soliton--type tail profiles on the half--lines. Tools from perturbation theory and Kreĭn--von Neumann extension theory for symmetric operators play a central role in the (in)stability analysis of such standing wave solutions. Our approach may be extended to other bound states for the NLS on looping graphs or more general non--compact metric graphs."}

By integrating a classical Fourier method with a deep convolutional neural network, we address the challenges inherent in sparse and noisy far-field data. The Fourier method provides a physics-informed, low-frequency approximation of the source, which serves as the input to a U-Net. The network is trained to map this coarse approximation to a high-fidelity source reconstruction, effectively suppressing truncation artifacts and recovering fine-scale geometric details. To enhance computational efficiency and robustness, we propose a high-to-low noise transfer learning strategy: a model pre-trained on high-noise regimes captures global topological features, offering a robust initialization for fine-tuning on lower-noise data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions with noise levels up to 100%, significantly outperforms traditional spectral methods under sparse measurement constraints, and generalizes well to unseen source geometries."}

Firstly, based on the global-in-time well-posedness in $L^{2}(Ω, \\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)$, we define a \\emph{continuous} non-autonomous dynamical system (NDS) on the metric space $(\\mathcal{P}_{2}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2), d_{\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)})$, where $d_{\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)}$ is the dual-Lipschitz distance on $\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)$, the space of probability measures on $\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2$. Specifically, we establish that this non-autonomous dynamical system admits a unique pullback measure attractor, characterized via measure-valued complete solutions and orbits in the sense of Wang (DOI.org/10.1016/j.jde.2012.05.015). Moreover, when the deterministic external forcing terms are periodic in time, we demonstrate that the pullback measure attractors are also periodic. We also study the upper semicontinuity of pullback measure attractors as $(ε_1, ε_2, γ_1, γ_2) \\rightarrow (0, 0, 0, 0)$. The main difficulty in proving the pullback asymptotic compactness of the NDS in $(\\mathcal{P}_{2}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2), d_{\\mathcal{P}(\\ell^2 \\times \\ell^2)})$ is caused by the lack of compactness in infinite-dimensional lattice systems, which is overcome by using uniform tail-ends estimates. And the inherent structure of the Selkov system precludes the possibility of any unidirectional dissipative influence arising from the interaction between the two coupled equations, thereby obstructing the emergence of a dominant energy-dissipation mechanism along a single directional pathway."}

We address the stabilization of reaction-diffusion systems on bounded domains $Ω\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \\le 3$) subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. A critical feature of this setting is the \"zero-mode singularity,\" where the Laplacian operator possesses a trivial zero eigenvalue ($λ_0=0$), providing no linear dissipation for the spatial mean. We rigorously prove the global well-posedness of the system and the existence of a compact global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ in the phase space $\\mathbb{H}=(L^2(Ω))^N$. Utilizing the Moser-Alikakos iteration technique, we establish uniform $L^\\infty(Ω)$ bounds, overcoming the lack of Sobolev embedding from $H^1$ into $L^\\infty$ in three dimensions. These bounds enable the derivation of explicit upper estimates for the fractal dimension of the attractor via the Kaplan-Yorke trace formula. We show that the dimension scales as $d_F(\\mathcal{A}) \\sim \\max\\{0, \\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{A}}-γ\\}^{d/2}$, confirming that the negative coupling strength $γ$ acts as a global regularizer that compresses the phase space. The theoretical results are validated using a stiff-stable Second-Order Exponential Time Differencing (ETD2) scheme with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to strictly enforce no-flux boundary conditions."}

Under the optimal regularity assumptions on the matrix-valued weight, suitable geometric flatness of the domain, and the prescribed data, we aim to investigate the effects of the problem structure on the level of integrability properties of solutions. To this end, we develop regularity in two regards: weighted Calderón-Zygmund-type and general weighted Orlicz-type estimates. A notable feature of our results is that, through a constructive level-set approach, the estimates can be derived with minimal dependence of the scaling parameter on the structural constants. The regularity results are then sharp in the sense that they enable the construction of a level-set estimate with nearly optimal scaling parameters, within admissible parameter sets."}

Therefore, a first task is to adapt the setting of these techniques to the deep learning setting. We shall use a battery of Kenig-Ponce-Vega suitable norms and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to describe this approximative scheme, proving rigorous bounds on the approximation for each critical and subcritical gKdV model.
