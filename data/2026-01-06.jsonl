The 3D model minimizes an energy functional that includes elastic strain energy, a damage-dependent degradation function $a_η(α)$, a damage energy term $w(α)$, and a gradient term penalizing abrupt damage variations. After non-dimensionalizing and rescaling, the problem is reformulated on a unit cylinder, and the behaviour of the energy functional is analyzed as $δ$ approaches zero. Using $Γ$-convergence, we show that the sequence of 3D energy functionals converges to a 1D functional, defined over displacement and damage fields that are independent of transverse coordinates. Compactness results guarantee the weak convergence of strains and damage gradients, while lower and upper bound inequalities confirm the energy limit. Minimizers of the 3D energy are proven to converge to the minimizers of the 1D energy, with strains approaching a diagonal form indicative of uniaxial deformation."}

Any comments are welcome", "summary": "This paper studies a two-phase free boundary problem governed by the ElectroHydroDynamic equations, which describes a perfectly conducting, incompressible, irrotational fluid with gravity, surrounded by a dielectric gas. The interface separating fluid and gas is referred to as the free boundary. \nIt is known that the free surface remains smooth away from the stagnation points, where the relative velocity of the incompressible fluid vanishes. In the presence of gravity, the Stokes conjecture, proved by Varvaruca and Weiss [Acta. Math. 206, 363-403, (2011)], implies that the corner type singularity will occur in the one-phase incompressible fluid. It is natural to ask whether this conjecture still holds in the two-phase flow problem. As a consequence, the primary objective of this work is to characterize the possible singular profiles of the free interface near the stagnation points in the presence of an electric field. \nOur main result is the discovery of a critical decay rate of the electric field near the stagnation points which indicates the classification of the singular profiles of the free surface. More precisely, we showed that when the decay rate of the electric field is faster than the critical decay rate, its negligible effect implies that the singular profile must be the well-known Stokes corner. When the electric field decays as the critical decay rate, the symmetry of the corner region may be broken, giving rise to either a Stokes corner or an asymmetric corner as the possible singular profile. If the decay rate is slower than the critical decay rate, the electric field dominates and completely destroys the corner structure, resulting in a cusp singularity. The analysis of these singularities relies on variational principles and geometric methods. Key technical tools include a Weiss-type monotonicity formula, a frequency formula, and a concentration-compactness argument."}

The spectral stability of these waves is then rigorously addressed. We perform a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operator around the wave of fixed period. A key element in this analysis is the monotonicity of the period map, which, when combined with Morse index theory, enables us to fully characterize the non-positive spectrum of the projected operator in the space of zero-mean periodic functions. Finally, by employing the Hamiltonian-Krein index analysis, we determine the spectral stability and instability of the constructed waves. We additionally discuss qualitative aspects of the Cauchy problem associated with the sinh-Gordon equation, including local well-posedness and blow-up phenomena. The former supports a new linearization of the problem, while the latter predicts the spectral instability of the wave."}

This article is dedicated to the memory of Haïm Brezis whose life and work were a great source of inspiration", "summary": "We are interested in how regular a transport velocity field must be in order to control Riesz-type commutators. Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2< s<d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space."}
