Since Hölder continuity constitutes the optimal regularity class for weak solutions to the porous medium equation, we establish analogous regularity results for bounded solutions of parabolic--parabolic chemotaxis systems in this setting. The proof is based on a refined De Giorgi--Di Benedetto iteration scheme adapted to the coupled structure of the system. These results advance the understanding of the fine regularity properties of chemotaxis models with nonlinear diffusion, and demonstrate that the interplay between singular diffusion and aggregation exhibits a regularizing mechanism consistent with the porous medium paradigm."}

Submitted to Fractional Calculus and Applied Analysis (FCAA)", "summary": "We introduce a new two-parameter fractional time operator with Volterra structure, denoted by the W-operator, defined through a generalized Laplace symbol. The operator preserves the Caputo-type high-frequency behavior while allowing a controlled modification of the low-frequency regime through an additional parameter, leading to regularized memory effects. We develop a complete symbolic and Volterra theory, including explicit Prabhakar-type kernels, a left-inverse Volterra integral, and a fractional fundamental theorem of calculus. We show that the natural factorization of the Laplace symbol does not fit the classical Bernstein product mechanism and that the symbol is not a Bernstein function in general. Despite this non-Bernstein character, we establish well-posedness of abstract fractional Cauchy problems with sectorial generators by resolvent estimates and Laplace inversion, yielding a W-resolvent family with temporal regularity and smoothing properties. As an illustration, we apply the theory to a W-fractional diffusion model and discuss the influence of the modulation parameter on the relaxation of spectral modes."}

Existence, uniqueness, and temporal regularity of mild solutions are established by Laplace transform techniques and contour integration, leading to the construction of associated resolvent families. A unified resolvent framework is developed, enabling a precise comparison between ABC and W dynamics and clarifying the influence of rational memory kernels on decay and smoothing properties.

Working in a weighted Sobolev space that combines the homogeneous Sobolev space with a weighted Lebesgue term, we establish continuous and compact embeddings of Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg type. These embeddings, together with a model that displays a natural scaling, allow us to apply the abstract critical point framework of Mercuri and Perera (2025), yielding a sequence of nonlinear eigenvalues for the associated problem. This scaling property leads to a classification of weighted power-type nonlinearities into subscaled, scaled, and superscaled regimes. Within this variational setting, we obtain broad existence and multiplicity results for equations driven by sums of weighted power nonlinearities, covering superscaled, scaled, and subscaled interactions, both in the subcritical and critical cases. We also provide a nonexistence result as a consequence of a Pohozaev-type identity. Finally, in the radial setting we employ improved radial CKN inequalities to enlarge the admissible embedding ranges. This yields strengthened radial versions of all our main results, including two-dimensional configurations with more singular weights, where no compact embeddings are available in the nonradial case."}

The Boussinesq regime is a good approximation of free surface Euler's equations when the non-linear parameter and the shallowness parameter are small. The vertical motion of the floating body is governed by the Newton equation. The full coupled wave-structure interaction problem under consideration is reduced to a boundary problem. The boundary condition satisfied by the discharge is given in terms of the vertical displacement of the floating cylinder. The latter is calculated using an ODE, which requires knowledge of the trace of the surface elevation and its second-time derivative. We use the dispersion in order to exhibit a hidden second order ODE on the trace of the surface elevation. This finally allows us to rewrite the waves-structure interaction problem as a system of non-local conservative PDEs plus bounded radial terms with a dispersive boundary layer, combined with an ODE at the boundary. This is what we call the Augmented formulation. Afterwards we showed that this formulation is well-posed with two different methods. Finally, we study the return to equilibrium situation in the linear regime. In particular, we improved previous results on the explicit time decay. We showed that the center mass of the floating body cannot converge to its equilibrium faster than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$ in 2D without viscosity and faster than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/2})$ with viscosity."}

We study a pseudodifferential operator with transversal intersections of bicharacteristics, where the principal symbol has double multiplicity, $p=dp=0$, in a small neigborhood $Ω$. Because of this fact, we instead study the subprincipal symbol b, and we can conclude that we get transport equations depending on b where sign changes for the imaginary part of b give approximative solutions with small support. These modes are used to estimate spectral instability, or the pseudospectrum. We also investigate the possibility that we can factorize the model operator as $P(h)=h^2P_1P_2,$ in this way actually annihilating the subprincipal symbol, thus there is no condition for the imaginary part of b. In a follow-up article, we examine different cases for more complex operators with tangential intersections of bicharacteristics, thereby generalizing the findings here."}
