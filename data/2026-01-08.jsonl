Rudimentary analytic techniques are used to guarantee a unique plane wave at every wavespeed $V>V_*$ above some threshold. The result readily extends to cutoff reactions, which are zero below some threshold product concentration. These results are not novel, but the method of proof is."}

In such systems, agents interact through weighted graphs whose structure evolves over time in a coupled manner with the agents' states, leading to non-exchangeable dynamics. In the dense-graph regime, we show that the asymptotic behavior is described by a Vlasov-type equation posed on an extended phase space that includes both the agents' states and identities and the evolving interaction weights. We establish this limiting equation through two complementary approaches. The first follows the mean-field methodology in the spirit of Sznitman [28]. In this framework, we impose the additional assumption that the weight dynamics is independent of one of the agent's states, an assumption that remains well motivated from a modeling perspective and allows for a direct derivation of the mean-field limit. The second approach is based on the graph limit framework and is formulated in a deterministic setting. This perspective makes it possible to remove the aforementioned restriction on the weight dynamics and to handle more general interaction structures. Our analysis includes wellposedness and stability results for the limiting Vlasov-type equation, as well as quantitative estimates ensuring the propagation of independence. We further clarify the relationship between the continuum (graph limit) formulation and the mean-field limit, thereby providing a unified description of the asymptotic dynamics of interacting particle systems on adaptive dynamical networks."}

This result requires no smallness assumption on the initial data. In sharp contrast to the three-dimensional case, where $(-1)$-homogeneous vector fields are locally square-integrable, the 2D problem is critical in the sense that the initial kinetic energy is locally infinite at the origin, and the initial vorticity fails to be locally integrable. Consequently, the classical local energy estimates are not available. To overcome this, we decompose the solution into a linear part solving the heat equation and a finite-energy perturbation part. By exploiting a kind of inherent cancellation relation between the linear part and the perturbation part, we can control interaction terms and establish the $H^1$-estimates for the perturbation part. Further investigating the corresponding Leray system in weighted Sobolev space, we can derive an optimal pointwise estimate. This gives the faster decay of the perturbation part at infinity and enables us to construct global-in-time self-similar solutions."}

Under a certain type of trapping potential, by establishing some delicate energy estimates, we present a detailed analysis on the concentration behavior of the solutions as the total strength of intraspecies and interspecies interactions tends to a critical value, where each component of the solutions blows up and concentrates at a flattest common minimum point of the associated trapping potentials. An optimal blow-up rate of solutions to the system is also given."}

In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $ψ(t)=t^α/α$ and prove that every $C_0$--$α$-semigroup $\\{T_α(t)\\}_{t\\ge0}$ can be written as $T_α(t)=T(ψ(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\\{T(s)\\}_{s\\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $α$-hypercyclicity and $α$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,α}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time."}
