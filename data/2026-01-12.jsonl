These waves are nearly phase-synchronized relaxation oscillations, featuring quasistationary plateaus of length $\\varepsilon^{-1}$ separated by fast transition layers, where $\\varepsilon\\ll1$ is the timescale separation parameter. Tracking the decay of modulations via a Bloch-wave eigenfunction analysis, we find a remarkably weak interaction strength of order $\\varepsilon^{8/3}$. This weak layer interaction and many of the technical difficulties arise from repeated scattering of eigenfunctions through fold points at the ends of the quasistationary plateaus. We capture this by combining a novel geometric desingularization approach with Lin's method, exponential trichotomies, and the Riccati transform. While our spectral stability analysis yields diffusive synchronization of all phase waves in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, it also identifies potential finite-wavelength instabilities, which we realize in a system variant."}

Originally discovered as a property of harmonic functions, Harnack inequalities have since been studied for solutions of wider classes of elliptic and parabolic problems. In this monograph, we take particular interest in deriving Harnack inequalities for solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. We focus on exploring the methods introduced by Li and Yau in the case of the linear heat equation and later extended to nonlinear problems by Auchmuty and Bao. Prior to presenting these results, we study a minimisation problem, which appears naturally in the proofs. After establishing a family of three general Harnack inequality results by Auchmuty and Bao, we investigate applications to deriving Harnack inequalities satisfied by solutions of the porous medium equation and weak solutions of the parabolic problem associated with the $p$-Laplace operator, which we refer to here as the $p$-diffusion equation. Finally, we demonstrate a common application of Harnack inequalities by proving the local space-time Hölder continuity of solutions to a class of linear evolution problems. The proof is based on methods introduced by Moser during his seminal work on Harnack inequalities during the 1960s. We conclude by suggesting potential opportunities for future work following on from the topics discussed here."}

Under standard spectral stability assumptions, we establish Lyapunov stability of the front against fully nonlocalized perturbations. Such perturbations could previously be treated only for scalar equations via comparison principles. We also prove that the leading-order dynamics of the perturbed front are governed by a modulation that tracks the motion of the front interface and evolves according to a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This effective description reveals that asymptotic orbital stability does not hold in general. However, asymptotic stability can be recovered by imposing localization of perturbations in the transverse spatial directions. The treatment of nonlocalized perturbations on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ poses significant challenges, both at the linear and nonlinear level. At the linear level, the neutral translational mode gives rise to continuous spectrum which touches the origin and cannot be projected out by conventional means, resulting in merely algebraic decay rates for the residual. Our linear estimates are necessarily $L^{\\infty}$-based, yielding significantly weaker decay rates than those available for $L^p$-localized perturbations. At the nonlinear level, quadratic gradient terms decay at a critical rate and cannot be treated perturbatively. We overcome these challenges by carefully decomposing the linearized dynamics, blending semigroup methods with ideas from the stability analysis of viscous shock waves, and introducing a novel nonlinear tracking scheme that combines spatiotemporal modulation with forcing techniques and the Cole-Hopf transform."}

Our approach successfully addresses highly general nonlinearities, including a subcritical term that does not need to satisfy the classical Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition and a critical term that extends far beyond the standard pure power assumption to include functions with oscillatory behavior. We prove the existence of ground states under two alternative conditions: either a strict energy gap between the minimax levels of the original and asymptotic problems or a direct energy comparison between the associated functionals. Some restrictive assumptions, such as specific decay rates for the coefficients or monotonicity properties of the nonlinearities, are not required in our results."}
