Our study highlights that the interplay of the advection term with the stresses given by the multivalued 1-Laplacian is a crucial feature of this model. Eventhough it is an interesting model in itsef, it can also be regarded as a one-dimensional version of the momentum balance of Hibler's model for sea-ice dynamics. Therein, the stress tensor is given by a term with similar properties as the 1-Laplacian in order to account for plastic effects of the ice. For our analysis we start out from a viscoplastic Burgers equation, i.e., a suitably regularized version of the plastic Burgers equation with a small regularization parameter $\\varepsilon>0$. For the viscoplastic Burgers equation, we construct a global BV-solution. In the singular limit $\\varepsilon\\to0$ we deduce the existence of a BV-solution for the plastic Burgers equation. In addition we show that the term arising as the limit of the regularized stresses is indeed related to an element of the subdifferential of the total variation functional."}

However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $ρ_0^β\\in H^3$ with $β\\in (\\frac{1}{3},γ-1]$ ($γ$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $β=γ-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $γ\\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $ρ_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties."}

We determine stability criteria for stationary solutions and describe the emergence of stable, non-trivial biomass distributions.
