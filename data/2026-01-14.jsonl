We introduce a novel regularization scheme based on a weighted pressure perturbation of the form $\\tilde{P}(ρ,δ) = \\int_δ^ρs^{-2}(s^2P'(s) - δ^2 P'(δ)) \\, ds$. Unlike previous methods that modify the continuity equation, our approach strictly preserves mass conservation while creating a degenerate hyperbolic boundary at the cut-off density $ρ=δ$. We provide a rigorous derivation of the eigenstructure and Riemann invariants for the perturbed system. A key theoretical contribution is the proof that the perturbed pressure exactly inherits the convexity properties of the original state equation ($2\\tilde{P}'+ρ\\tilde{P}'' = 2P'+ρP''$), thereby ensuring the strict convexity of the mechanical energy entropy without additional assumptions. Using the method of vanishing viscosity, we derive uniform $L^\\infty$ bounds via invariant regions and establish the $H^{-1}_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ compactness of entropy dissipation measures. The global existence for the vacuum-free limit is then proved using the theory of compensated compactness and singular perturbation analysis of the entropy equations."}

Each dimer consists of a high-contrast dielectric nanoparticle and a moderately contrasting plasmonic nanoparticle separated by a subwavelength distance. The cluster is assumed to contain many such dimers whose size $a$ is small compared to the wavelength, with intra-dimer and inter-dimer distances scaling like $a^{t_1}$ and $a^{t_2}$, and the frequency is tuned near suitable electric and magnetic resonances of the associated Newtonian and magnetization operators on the reference shapes.\n  Under these geometric, contrast and spectral assumptions, we derive a Foldy--Lax type approximation for the Maxwell system. We show that the scattered field and its far field admit asymptotic expansions in terms of four moments attached to each dimer, which solve an explicit finite-dimensional linear system. We prove invertibility of this system under quantitative smallness conditions on the contrast and the dimer density, and we obtain error estimates uniform in the number of dimers.\n  By extracting the dominant components, we further show that each hybrid dimer behaves, at leading order, as a co-located electric and magnetic dipole driven by the local fields, and we identify the corresponding $6\\times 6$ polarizability matrix. This provides a discrete model for clusters of hybrid dimers that is suitable for fast forward simulations, inverse schemes, and as input for effective-medium descriptions.

This choice of potential has the effect that the fluid mixture cannot fully separate into two pure phases. The notion of dissipative solutions is based on a relative energy-dissipation inequality featuring a suitable regularity weight. In this way, this is a very weak solution concept. In the present work, we study the well-posedness of the geodynamical two-phase flow in the notion of energy-variational solutions. They feature an additional scalar energy variable that majorizes the system energy along solutions and they are further characterized by a variational inequality that combines an energy-dissipation estimate with the weak formulation of the system adding an error term that accounts for the mismatch between the energy variable and the system energy multiplied by a suitable regularity weight. We give a comparison of these two concepts. We further study different phase-field potentials for the geodynamical two-phase flow model. In particular, we address the variational limit from a potential with a logarithmic contribution to a double-obstacle potential, then also allowing for the emergence of pure phases. This study underlines that, thanks to its structure, the energy-variational solution is better suited for variational convergence methods than the dissipative solution."}

We then completely classify the vanishing viscosity limit in specific planar domains.\n  In a bounded connected domain, we show that the only vanishing viscosity limit is the constant-vorticity flow. This result does not require the approximating Navier-Stokes solutions to have nested closed streamlines, an essential assumption in the century-old Prandtl-Batchelor theorem. In a strip where the Navier-Stokes velocity (but not the pressure) is periodic in the strip direction, we show that the only vanishing viscosity limits are constant flow, Couette flow, and Poiseuille flow. The proof of the latter result relies on the former and on a powerful rigidity theorem, which asserts that any non-shear steady Euler flow in a periodic strip must have contractible closed streamlines."}

We begin with explicit examples where bounded initial data leads to $L^{\\infty}$ blow-up despite flux regularity. More strikingly, we demonstrate that Kružkov's entropy equalities alone fail to ensure uniqueness in this regime by constructing infinitely many entropy solutions to a single Cauchy problem with bounded initial datum, each continuous in time with respect to the $L^{1}$ norm. Thus, we demonstrate that the $L^{\\infty}$ assumption is essential for the doubling of variables argument, and hence for the uniqueness of entropy solutions to scalar conservation laws. On the positive side, we develop a novel theory for scalar conservation laws with spatial heterogeneity by adapting the front tracking method. We recover uniqueness by imposing a Lax-type condition in addition to the entropy inequality, motivated by the properties of our front tracking approximations. Unbounded Kružkov solutions do not necessarily satisfy the weak formulation; we show that global weak solutions may not even exist in a natural class for some Cauchy problems of this form, even when Kružkov entropy solutions exist. Finally, we construct an explicit example of global ill-posedness with bounded initial datum."}
