For a strong solution $v$ with initial data $a$, we establish \\emph{a priori} bounds in $L^\\infty(0, \\infty; H^1(Ω)) \\cap L^2(0, \\infty; \\dot H^2(Ω))$, the exponential part of which is $\\exp(C \\|a\\|_{L^2(Ω)}^2)$. This is in contrast to the upper bounds reported in the existing literature that are double exponential. Furthermore, the uniform-in-time estimate for the Neumann condition case, in which the Poincaré inequality is unavailable for $v$, seems to be new."}

Existence and uniqueness of a local-in-time strong solution in a maximal-$L^2$-regularity class and in a Kiselev--Ladyzhenskaya class are proved by discretization in time (also known as Rothe's method), provided that a corresponding stationary Stokes problem admits a regularity structure better than $V$ (which is typically $H^2$-regularity in case of the Navier--Stokes equations). Since we do not assume the cancelation property $\\left< B(u, v), v \\right> = 0$, in applications we may allow for broader boundary conditions than those treated by the existing literature."}

In particular we derive and study a new weakly nonlinear asymptotic model of multilayer tumor growth. The model takes the form of a nonlinear and nonlocal high order system of PDEs. Finally, motivated by the possibility of a finite time collision of the interfaces, we study the well-posedness of this system."}

We study a variational model in which the nematic director is constrained to lie in the tangent space of an axisymmetric surface, and the associated surface energy accounts for both surface tension and elastic nematic contributions. Here we adopt the surface gradient as the differential operator on the surface, we restrict our analysis to revolution surfaces spanning two coaxial rings, and we assume that the nematic director is aligned along parallels. In this setting, the energy functional reduces to a one-dimensional variational problem. We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of minimizers and we provide their complete geometric characterization. Finally, we run some numerical simulations."}

When the moving thin domain shrinks to a given closed moving hypersurface as its thickness tends to zero, we rigorously derive a limit problem by showing the weak convergence of the weighted average of a weak solution to the thin-domain problem and characterizing the limit function as a unique weak solution to the limit problem. The limit problem obtained in this paper is a system of a nonlinear partial differential equation and an algebraic equation on the moving hypersurface. This seems to be somewhat strange, but we also find that the limit problem can be seen as a new kind of local mass conservation law on the moving hypersurface with a normal flux."}

We first prove that the gradient of the solution remains bounded when the conductors possess partially ``flat\" boundaries. This contrasts with the case involving strictly convex inclusions, where the gradient can blow up. Second, for conductors with $C^{1,γ}$ boundaries ($γ\\in(0,1)$), we establish both upper and lower bounds on the gradient, with optimal blow-up rates. Furthermore, we provide precise asymptotic expansions in some special cases."}

The same result holds for periodic unbounded domains with two boundary components. In particular, any such domain is determined by suitable holomorphic data in some algebraic curve. As a consequence, the space of all Serrin ring domains, or periodic Serrin bands, can be ordered into a sequence of finite-dimensional complexity levels. By studying the first non-trivial level, given by elliptic functions, we construct: $(i)$ a global $1$-parameter family of periodic solutions to Serrin's problem that interpolates between a flat band and a chain of disks along an axis, following an unduloid pattern, and $(ii)$ for any $n>1$, a two-dimensional moduli space ${\\bf T}_n$ of non-radial Serrin ring domains with a dihedral symmetry group of order $2n$.
