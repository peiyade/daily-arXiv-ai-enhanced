Using a novel comparison technique based on convex hypersurfaces inspired by Choi, Gálvez, and Lozano, we overcome the absence of totally geodesic foliations, which are instrumental in the hyperbolic space. Our results highlight the interplay between curvature, the spectrum of the Laplacian, and the geometry of the asymptotic boundary."}

We first derive commutator estimates in these spaces, dispensing with the conventional divergence-free condition, via the Bony paraproduct decomposition and vector-valued maximal function inequalities. Building on these estimates and combining the method of characteristics with a compactness argument, we then obtain the new a priori estimates and prove local well-posedness for the transport equation in Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. The resulting theory is applicable to a wide range of evolution equations, including models for incompressible and compressible ideal fluid flows, shallow water waves, among others. As an illustration, we consider the incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system. Employing the general transport theory developed here yields a complete local well-posedness result in the sense of Hadamard, covering both sub-critical and critical regularity regimes, and provides corresponding blow-up criteria for the ideal MHD equations in Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Our results refine and substantially extend earlier work in this direction."}

One is the quasi-geostrophic equation, and the other is the convection-diffusion equation. Both are two-dimensional bilinear equations, and the order of differentiation is the same. Naturally, their scales also coincide. However, the direction in which the nonlinear effects act differs: one acts along the isothermal surface, while the other acts along the temperature gradient in a specified direction. The main assertion quantifies this difference through the large-time behavior of their solutions. In particular, the nonlinear distortions in the asymptotic profiles of both equations are compared. In this context, the spatial symmetry of the first approximation plays a crucial role, but the solutions require no symmetry."}

We show that the essential spectrum of this operator is $[\\frac14,\\infty)$ and that, under convexity assumption on the domain, there exist discrete eigenvalues below $\\frac14$ if, and only if, the Robin parameter is below a non-positive critical constant, which depends on the shape of the domain. As the main result, we prove that the lowest Robin eigenvalue for the exterior of a bounded geodesically convex domain $Ω$ in the hyperbolic plane does not exceed such an eigenvalue for the exterior of the geodesic disk, whose geodesic curvature of the boundary is not smaller than the averaged geodesic curvature of the boundary of $Ω$. This result implies as a consequence that under fixed area or fixed perimeter constraints the exterior of the geodesic disk maximises the lowest Robin eigenvalue among exteriors of bounded geodesically convex domains. Moreover, we obtain under the same geometric constraints a reverse inequality between the critical constants."}

We study the scattering resonances of the associated self-adjoint Hamiltonian, defined as the poles of the meromorphic continuation of its resolvent.\n  We obtain a sharp asymptotic description of resonances near the real axis as $τ\\to0$. Near each nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the interior Lamé operator there is a cluster of resonances lying just below it in the complex plane; in this wavelength-scale regime the imaginary parts are of order $τ$ with non-vanishing leading coefficients. In addition, near zero (a subwavelength regime), we identify resonances with real parts of order $\\sqrtτ$ and prove a lifetime dichotomy: their imaginary parts are of order $τ$ generically, but of order $τ^2$ for an explicit admissible set $\\mathcal E$. This yields a classification of long-lived elastic resonances in the high-contrast limit.\n  We also establish resolvent asymptotics for both fixed-size resonators and microresonators. We derive explicit expansions with a finite-rank leading term and quantitative remainder bounds, valid near both wavelength-scale and subwavelength resonances. For microresonators, at the wavelength scale the dominant contribution is an anisotropic elastic point scatterer. Near the zero eigenvalue, the leading-order behaviour is of monopole or dipole type, and we give a rigorous criterion distinguishing the two cases."}

It turns out that half-space solutions are global minimizers for the two-sided Alt-Caffarelli functional, but not in the one-sided case. In addition, we identify a further class of global minimizers, all of which have constant Laplacian. Recent work by J. Lamboley and M. Nahon reduces potential global minimizers in dimension two to four possible categories. Our work shows that three of these categories persist in any dimension and are in fact global minimizers.\n  Moreover, we show that minimizers of the two-sided biharmonic Alt-Caffarelli problem do in general not satisfy a partial differential equation, not even with a signed measure as right-hand-side. This is in sharp contrast to the corresponding one-sided problem."}

This function is intimately linked to Matheron's set covariogram from convex geometry.
