Assuming a uniform energy bound, the sequence $\\{(u_\\varepsilon, v_\\varepsilon)\\}_{\\varepsilon>0}$ converges in $L^2(Ω)$ to a limit $(u, 1)$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, where $u$ is in $SBV^2(Ω)$. It was previously shown that if the full Ambrosio-Tortorelli energy associated to $(u_\\varepsilon,v_\\varepsilon)$ converges to the Mumford-Shah energy of $u$, then the first inner variation converges as well. In particular, $u$ is a critical point of the Mumford-Shah functional in the sense of inner variations. In this work, focusing on the two-dimensional setting, we extend this result under the sole convergence of the phase-field energy to the length energy term in the Mumford-Shah functional."}

In this abstract setting, we develop a new approach to existence and multiplicity of solutions with prescribed norm in $H$. We then consider various applications of this approach. First, we obtain, under fairly general assumptions including the mass-supercritical case, the existence of infinitely many solutions to a class of nonlinear (time-independent) Schrödinger equations on a compact graph $\\mathcal{G}$ with prescribed (arbitrarily large) mass. Moreover, we derive a similar existence and multiplicity result for a biharmonic semilinear equation in the $2$-torus. For a larger class of second order and higher order equations in a bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we also show the existence of multiple solutions with prescribed small mass.\n  The solutions we obtain are detected as ground states of Nehari-Pankov type for the associated $λ$-dependent action functional, where $λ$ varies in a spectral gap between sufficiently large eigenvalues of $A$. The key observation in this abstract framework is the fact that the $H$-norms of these $λ$-dependent solution families form connected sets. To estimate the size of these connected sets in specific settings, we use Weyl type estimates for the length of spectral gaps, variational characterizations of eigenvalues, bounds for associated eigenfunctions and a classical bound from analytic number theory."}

These grow and division cycles have been proposed as a model for protocells and are believed to play a fundamental role in living systems by providing chemical compartments which are important in the organization of living systems. This paper analyses chemically active Mullins-Sekerka models. Existence of radially symmetric solutions is shown and a detailed stability analysis in radial as well as planar situations is given. In particular, we also analyze multilayered solutions leading to shell-type situations. Finally, we introduce a numerical method based on a parametric finite element approach that explicitly accounts for topological changes, thereby allowing for droplet splitting and merging. Several numerical simulations verify the findings of the theoretical stability analysis and show complex dynamical behavior, including multiple instabilities, splittings of droplets and appearance of shell-type solutions."}

We restrict ourselves to the case in which the nonlinear gradient term has a scaling less or equal than the fractional order of the diffusion. In similarity to its second-order counterpart, we provide existence of ergodic pairs involving solutions that blow-up on $\\partial Ω$. We use the celebrated vanishing discount method, where the analysis of the approximated solutions have its own interest, leading to qualitative properties for the ergodic problem such as precise blow-up rates for the solution and characterization of the ergodic constant. The main difficulties arise from the state-dependency of the operator, from which the arguments of the local case based on well-known invariance properties of the Laplacian are not longer at disposal."}

We introduce a constructive strategy that embeds a subwavelength periodic array of resonant high-density (hard) inclusions to create an effective medium with a uniform negative density shift. Specifically, we place a periodic cluster of inclusions of size $a$ and density $ρ_1\\asymp a^{-2}$ strictly inside $Ω$. For frequencies $ω$ tuned to an eigenvalue of the elastic Newton (Kelvin) operator of a single inclusion, we show that as $a\\to0$ and the number of inclusions $M\\to\\infty$, the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map $Λ_D$ converges to an effective map $Λ_{\\mathcal{P}}$ corresponding to a background density shift $-\\mathcal{P}^2$, with the operator norm estimate $\\|Λ_D-Λ_{\\mathcal{P}}\\|\\le Ca^α\\mathcal{P}^6$ for some $α>0$ determined by the geometric scaling. Around this negative background we derive a first-order linearization of $Λ_{\\mathcal{P}}$ in terms of $ρ$ and the Newton volume potential for the shifted Lamé operator. Testing the linearized relation with complex geometric optics solutions yields an explicit reconstruction formula for the Fourier transform of $ρ$, and hence a global density recovery scheme. The results provide a metamaterial-inspired analytic framework for inverse coefficient problems in linear elasticity and a concrete paradigm for leveraging nanoscale resonators in reconstruction algorithms."}
