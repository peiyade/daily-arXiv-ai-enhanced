The fluid is bound by a gravitational force to a flat rigid bottom and meets an atmosphere of constant pressure at the top with its free surface, where it does not experience any capillarity effects. Additionally, the fluid is subject to a fixed, but arbitrarily selected, forcing data profile with variable amplitude. We use the Riemann mapping to equivalently reformulate the resulting two-dimensional free boundary problem as a single one-dimensional fully nonlinear pseudodifferential equation for a function describing the domain's geometry. By discovering a hidden ellipticity in the reformulated equation, we are able to import a global implicit function theorem to construct a connected set of traveling waves, containing both the quiescent solution and large amplitude members. We find that either solutions continue to exist for arbitrarily large data amplitude or else one of a finite number of meaningful breakdown scenarios must occur. This work stands as the first non perturbative construction of large traveling surface waves in any free boundary viscous fluid without surface tension."}

Interactions subject to these protocols may depend on both the Euclidean distance between agents and on the mass distribution between them -- the `topological' component. When the interaction protocol is regular, we prove sufficient conditions for the existence of global-in-time classical solutions, related to the initial nonnegativity of a conserved quantity of the system. The remainder of our results explore the case where the interactions are `purely' topological and the interactions do not depend on the Euclidean distance. We show that in this case, the system decouples into an autonomous velocity equation in mass coordinates together with a scalar conservation law with time-dependent flux determined by the velocity. We analyze the long-time behavior for the dynamics associated to both regular and singular protocols."}

This result generalizes previous works of Hoff (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 55 (2002), pp. 1365--1407) and Perepelitsa (Arch. Ration. Mech.

The intermediate-regularity class developed here may be viewed as a natural extension of Hoff's theory, precisely tailored to overcome the two corresponding obstructions: the lack of global space-time control of the effective viscous flux arising from far-field vacuum and the absence of boundary-induced regularity gains in the no-slip setting."}

It is not difficult to produce an example of an elliptic differential operator on $(M,g)$ that has the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue. Indeed, $Δ_g^2 + λ_2 Δ_g$ does the job, where $Δ_g:=div_g \\nabla_g$. and where $λ_2$ is the second lowest eigenvalue of the operator $-Δ_g$. The question that remains is how rare are elliptic differential operators whose lowest eigenvalue has this property. In this paper, the author proves that elliptic operators of the form $Δ_g^2 - div_g(T-λ_2 g^{-1}) d$, where $T$ is a negative semi-definite $(2,0)$-tensor field on $M$, and where $g^{-1}$ is the inverse metric tensor, have the property that there exists a sign-changing eigenfunction that is associated with the lowest eigenvalue of the operator.

In other words, non-uniqueness does not occur merely for a single or even finitely many trajectories, but instead on a set of initial conditions $E$ of positive Lebesgue measure. In fact, the set $E$ has full measure inside a cube where the construction is supported. Moreover, we also construct a divergence-free velocity field $v \\in C_{t}C^ω_x$ for which the associated continuity equation admits two distinct solutions $μ^1$ and $μ^2$ which are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure for almost every time, and start from the same initial datum $\\bar μ\\ll \\mathscr{L}^{d}$. Our construction introduces two novel ideas: (i) We introduce the notion of \"parallelization\", where at each time, the velocity field consists of simultaneous motion across multiple nested spatial scales. This differs from most explicit constructions in the literature on mixing or anomalous dissipation, where the velocity on different scales acts at separate times. This is crucial to cover the whole class of non-Osgood moduli of continuity. (ii) Inspired by a recent work of Bruè, Colombo and Kumar, we develop a new fixed-point framework that naturally incorporates the parallelization mechanism.

The first one is when one scaling is much larger than the others. In this case, one bubble does not concentrate (hence stabilize) and the other bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-2/(N-6)}$ together with strong sign constraints. Next, assuming we are not in the first scenario, we establish a non-degenerate condition on the positions of bubbles to obtain that all bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-1/(N-4)}$. The last case we consider is a degenerate, but not too much degenerate, scenario. Here again, we obtain that all bubbles concentrate with the universal blow-up speed $t^{-1/(N-3)}$.

We show that geodesics associated with this metric exhibit a non-locality property: almost every time, they are supported on the whole state space, independently of the choice of endpoints. Moreover, along optimal curves, the source term displays a characteristic temporal profile, with mass creation occurring at early times and subsequent decay as the curve approaches the target measure.

Our approach is built on the symmetrization technique on manifolds, combined with a novel Jacobian-type transformation that provides a precise way for comparing volume growth, level sets, and gradient terms across the two geometries of Euclidean and manifold settings. When coupled with symmetrization, this framework yields sharp control over the relevant functionals and reveals how the underlying curvature influences extremal behavior. Our result generalizes the seminal result of Cianchi-Ferone [Ann. Inst. H. Poincaré C Anal. Non Linéaire 25 (2008)] to the curved spaces. Moreover, building upon this transformation, we succeed in extending Sobolev-Lorentz embedding-classically formulated in the Euclidean setting to the broader framework of Cartan-Hadamard models and we establish an optimal Sobolev-Lorentz embedding in this geometric setting.
