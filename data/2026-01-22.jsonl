We provide a rigorous proof of the existence of a critical Taylor number $T_c$, at which the Couette flow loses stability.\n  For Taylor numbers just above $T_c$, under fixed axial periodicity, the solutions to the limiting Navier-Stokes system are governed by a Ginzburg-Landau-type partial differential equation. Beyond the classical Taylor vortex flow, we demonstrate that a two-parameter family of solutions emerges at criticality for $T>T_c$.

Our main contribution is a sharp characterization of the existence of mild solutions in terms of $α$, the spatial dimension $N$, and the coefficients of the local and nonlocal diffusion terms. In particular, when the Laplacian term is absent, no mild solution exists, whereas for $λ>0$ the admissible regimes depend critically on $(α,N)$, extending and sharpening the known results for purely local fractional stochastic heat equations. Numerical simulations illustrate the evolution of the mean and variance and emphasize subdiffusive spreading and memory effects."}

In particular, the admissible regularities go beyond the $H^{-1}$-scale, which is a well-known threshold for KdV. As a byproduct, by reversing the gauge transform, we are able to improve on the known theory for KdV and derive sharp local well-posedness in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces with large integrability exponent. Our strategy is based on an infinite normal form reduction and Fourier restriction estimates, together with a thorough exploitation of algebraic cancellations. Additionally, our method is totally independent of the KdV completely integrable structure, and extends to other non-integrable models with quadratic nonlinearities."}

We show that solutions to these equations have a partial regularity estimate which captures differences of the solution up to the scale at which the kernel has a truncation in its singularity. The estimates we provide are robust with respect to the truncation parameter, and they include the existing results for the original operators without truncation.
