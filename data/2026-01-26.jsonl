In this setting, uncertainty phenomena are shown to be intrinsically\n  directional and confined to an effective phase-space dimension given by $\\mathrm{rank}(B)$.\n  First, we prove sharp Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl type inequalities involving only the directions\n  corresponding to $\\ker(B)^\\perp$, with explicit lower bounds expressed in terms of geometric\n  quantities associated with the underlying symplectic transformation. We also provide a complete\n  characterization of all extremizers, which turn out to be partially Gaussian functions with free\n  behavior along the null directions of $B$.\n  Building on this framework, we extend the Beurling-Hörmander theorem to the metaplectic\n  setting, obtaining a precise polynomial-Gaussian structure for functions satisfying suitable\n  exponential integrability conditions involving both $f$ and its metaplectic transform. Finally,\n  we prove a Morgan-type (or Gel'fand--Shilov type) uncertainty principle for metaplectic operators,\n  identifying a sharp threshold separating triviality from density of admissible functions and\n  showing that this threshold is invariant under metaplectic transformations.\n  Our results recover the classical Fourier case and free metaplectic transformations as special\n  instances, and reveal the geometric and anisotropic nature of uncertainty principles in the\n  presence of symplectic degeneracies."}

We establish a rigorous mathematical backbone with forward invariance of the nonnegative cone and global-in-time well-posedness. Exploiting the decoupled drug equation $\\partial_t I=d_IΔI-γ_I I$, we prove a long-time reduction during washout and show that the damped base dynamics admit no diffusion-driven (Turing-type) instability. We then formulate a directionality--damping principle: unidirectional (open-loop) sensing yields at most transient focusing, whereas bidirectional (closed-loop) feedback reshapes the effective mobility and produces explicit thresholds separating stable homogeneity, finite-band patterning (resistance niche formation), and aggregation when strong parabolicity is violated. Reproducible simulations corroborate this classification and highlight when flux regularization is required for physical realism."}

Eliminating the bulk variables, we reformulate the coupled three-dimensional system as an evolution on the film involving the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator. We identify the Fourier symbol of the DtN operator and show it coincides with that of the fractional Laplacian, which yields an explicit Fourier-multiplier representation and allows construction of the corresponding fundamental solution. Using this representation we express the surface velocity as a convolution of the fundamental solution with the interfacial curvature forcing and analyze its normal limit to derive a boundary integral equation for the moving curve. Independently, exploiting the DtN representation we establish a curve-shortening identity: the interfacial perimeter decreases monotonically and its time derivative is controlled by $\\dot{H}^{1/2}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$-norm of the surface velocity. Building on the boundary integral equation, we prove local well-posedness via maximal $L^2$-regularity for quasilinear parabolic systems, employing a DeTurck-type reparametrization, and show equivalence with the original ILLSS system. Finally, we introduce a linearly implicit parametric finite-element scheme which captures experimentally observed relaxation dynamics."}
