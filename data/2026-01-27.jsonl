As the width of the connecting neck shrinks, these eigenfunctions converge to Neumann eigenfunctions defined over the ends of the dumbbell, together with a one-dimensional Sturm-Liouville solution in the neck. In this limit, the corresponding eigenvalues become degenerate, with multiplicity two. The nodal deficiency, defined as the difference between the eigenvalue index and the nodal domain count, is known by the Courant nodal domain theorem to be nonnegative. We show that, for small neck widths, the nodal deficiencies of the dumbbell eigenfunctions are no smaller than the nodal deficiencies of the limiting eigenfunctions in the ends, and we provide conditions under which equality is achieved. As a consequence, we establish a criterion for identifying eigenfunctions of zero nodal deficiency for the dumbbell domain."}

The proof characterizes iteration steps independent of the choice of the parameter, which are indeed manipulated by intrinsic natures of potentials and nonlinear terms, and furthermore presents precise estimates for asymptotically linear functions or continuous nonlinear terms restricted on a bounded domain in RN.

We show that solutions initially close to a soliton converge, up to translation, weakly in $H^1(\\R)$ as time tends to infinity to a (possibly different) soliton. The analysis is based on a Liouville-type rigidity theorem characterizing solutions that remain localized near a soliton trajectory.\n  A central feature of the proof is a complete spectral resolution of the linearized CH operator around a soliton. This linear theory is obtained via the bi-Hamiltonian and integrable structure of the CH equation, through the recursion operator and the completeness of the associated squared eigenfunctions. It provides a substitute for the classical spectral framework used in KdV and gKdV equations, which is unavailable in the nonlocal and variable-coefficient setting of CH.\n  The spectral resolution yields sharp decay estimates for the linearized flow in exponentially weighted spaces, which in turn lead to the nonlinear rigidity result and the asymptotic stability of a single soliton. Combined with known orbital stability results, this approach extends to well-ordered trains of solitons and to the explicit multi-soliton solutions generated by the inverse scattering method.

In this setup, the fluid on top is heavier and more viscous than the fluid below. Under the effect of gravity, this system becomes unstable, and finger-like structures appear. The phenomenon is described mathematically by coupling Darcy's law with a convection-diffusion reaction equation. The nonlinearity in this model arises mainly from the concentration dependence of viscosity and the convective transport term. The existence of a unique pair of weak solutions is shown in both two and three dimensions using the Galerkin approximation method and truncation technique. Moreover, an application of the maximum principle shows non-negativity of the concentration. Additionally, we analyze the long-time behavior of the solution and prove that the concentration converges exponentially to zero in the $L^p$-norm for all $1 \\le p \\le \\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty.$ To complement the theoretical analysis, we perform numerical simulations based on a pressure formulation. By tracking total kinetic energy and mixing measures over time, we discuss the instability and the mixing efficiency, respectively. The present study reveals that although increasing the density contrast amplifies the total kinetic energy, the marginal impact diminishes with successive increments of density contrast. Similarly, while adsorption acts to suppress mixing, its efficiency in doing so tends to saturate with further increases. These non-linear sensitivities are predicted by our theoretical estimates and confirmed by the numerical simulations."}

However, their analytic treatment remains limited, as the AB kernel does not fall within the classical Volterra or Bernstein-function frameworks.\n  This paper develops a unified resolvent approach for AB-type evolution equations in Banach spaces. Using a Laplace-domain formulation inspired by Hille--Phillips theory, we introduce a fractional resolvent associated with the AB kernel and establish optimal bounds on sectorial contours. Under the natural condition $β<1+α$, we construct an AB--Mittag--Leffler resolvent family and obtain a complete representation of mild solutions to the AB Cauchy problem. Sharp stability and regularity estimates of Mittag--Leffler type are derived, including fractional-domain bounds.\n  Numerical illustrations confirm the predicted decay, and connections with non-autonomous operators, maximal $L^p$-regularity, and weighted AB kernels are outlined.

We use the abstract theory of (nonlinear) semigroups generated by subgradients of proper, lower semicontinuous and convex functionals on Hilbert spaces to build a rigorous and applicable framework that works for many classical elliptic operators but also nonlocal or sometimes fractional operators. After recalling the notion of a nonlinear semigroup generated by subgradients and $j$-subgradients of the associated energy functions, we introduce a general class of (nonlinear) nonlocal elliptic type operators and define rigorously subgradients and $j$-subgradients of such functionals that generate (nonlinear) submarkovian semigroups and hence, the abstract Cauchy problem associated with these subgradients and/or $j$-subgradients is wellposed. The existence and the qualitative properties of solutions to these Cauchy problems and the corresponding semigroups are investigated. More precisely, we show some comparison and maximum principles, submarkovian, domination, ultracontractivity properties, and some Hölder type estimates for these semigroups of operators. These results are usually useful in several branches of pure and applied partial differential equations. We finish the paper by giving several examples of nonlocal operators in Euclidean spaces, graphs, metric random walk spaces, fractional Brownian motions, and Lévy flights, that fit in our general framework."}

We support these analytical results with numerical simulations that confirm the predicted growth phenomena. In the stable configuration, where the denser fluid lies below the lighter fluid, we show that certain initial configurations evolve into the unstable regime in finite time."}

This paper focuses on the initial-boundary problem of the 3D incompressible anisotropic Boussinesq system with horizontal dissipation. The goal here is to assess the stability property and large-time behavior of perturbations near the hydrostatic balance. By utilizing the structure of the system, the energy methods and the means of bootstrapping argument, we prove the global stability property in the Sobolev space $H^3(\\mathbb{R}^3_+)$. After taking a Fourier transform in $x_h = (x_1, x_2)$ and Fourier cosine and sine transforms in $x_3$ for the system, we obtain the decay rates for the global solution itself as well as its derivatives."}

Under minimal structural assumptions on the graph, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity of mild solutions for initial data in $\\ell^p$ spaces, with $1\\leq p<\\infty$. Our approach relies on time discretization via an implicit Euler scheme and an exhaustion technique using Dirichlet subgraphs. As a by-product, we obtain existence and uniqueness results for a related time-independent equation. Finite-time extinction and positivity for solutions under a specific forcing term are also proved."}

The macroscopic unknown is driven by a dissipative anomalous diffusion (of SQG-type) and is coupled with the orientation of the crystal, moving by the gradient flow of the energy of maps. The main idea of such models is to have a better insight on the vorticity formulation of the Liquid Crystal Flow and to tackle some regularity issues in the associated conserved geometric motions. One of the advantage of the present PDEs is to capture features of the Navier-Stokes equations (or Euler) through a {\\sl scalar} unknown, keeping the advection-diffusion structure of the orientation field. We obtain regularity for mild solutions under natural assumptions for the initial data, which are actually near-optimal. Along the way, we also draw some links with natural models of (anti-)ferromagnets previously investigated."}
