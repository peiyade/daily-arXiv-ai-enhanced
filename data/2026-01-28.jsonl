Classical analyses, beginning with Lamb's representation of the half-space response, typically assume an infinite plate and rely on diagonalization of the soil operator via the continuous Hankel transform. For a plate of finite radius $R$, however, both traction and displacement are supported only on $0 \\le r \\le R$, leading to the spatially truncated Lamb operator \\[ \\mathscr{M}(ω) = χ_{[0,R]} \\, T(ω)\\, χ_{[0,R]}, \\] where $T(ω)$ is the Hankel multiplier involving the Rayleigh denominator $Ω(ξ,ω)$. Truncation destroys the diagonal structure of $T(ω)$ and introduces real-axis singularities associated with the Rayleigh pole, in addition to square-root branch points at $ξ= k_T$ and $ξ= k_L$. We represent the action of $\\mathscr{M}(ω)$ on a finite-disk Bessel basis $\\{ φ_n(r) = A_{1,n} J_0(λ_n r) + A_{2,n} I_0(λ_n r)\\},$ which satisfies the free-edge boundary conditions of the plate, and derive explicit expressions for the resulting matrix elements. These involve integrals of the Lamb kernel evaluated as Cauchy principal values, with residue contributions corresponding to radiation damping in the half-space. The resulting operator matrix is dense but spectrally convergent. Its inversion yields a complete frequency-domain solution for finite-radius plates. The analysis reproduces Chen et al.'s finite-radius experiments for small $R$, approaches the infinite-radius limit as $R \\to \\infty$, and quantifies finite-radius corrections. To our knowledge, this is the first exact operator-level treatment of finite-radius plate-half-space interaction that retains the full nonlocal Lamb kernel."}

Moreover, we show that these quantitative estimates propagate in weak topologies and, in particular, lead to optimal convergence rates in the bounded Lipschitz distance. The results apply on both the torus and the whole space, providing a unified quantitative description of the light particle hydrodynamic limit."}

Recently, for the Dirichlet BVP with data $g$, Caetano et al (2025) have proposed an integral equation (IE) $A_kφ=g$ that applies for arbitrary compact $Γ$. This formulation is a generalisation of standard first kind IEs, where the BIO is $S_k$, the single-layer BIO on a surface $Γ$, that apply when $Γ$ is the boundary of a Lipschitz domain or a screen.\n  In this paper we study the dependence of $A_k$ on $k$, showing that, for $k\\geq k_0>0$, $\\|A_k\\|\\leq ck$ while $\\|A_k^{-1}\\| \\leq c'k$ if $Γ$ is star-shaped, where $c, c'>0$ depend only on $k_0$ and $Γ$.

We show that this framework encompasses Eringen's nonlocal elasticity model as a particular case, establishing an explicit connection between the two formulations.

Building on the modern framework of solution stability and Morse index theory, the work investigates how these notions influence regularity in nonlinear elliptic problems. A central contribution is the construction of a counterexample showing that bounded radial Morse index does not prevent singular behavior of solutions in dimensions three through nine, challenging a natural extension of the Brezis-Vázquez regularity conjecture. In addition, optimal regularity results are established for radial solutions of a non-autonomous Hardy-Hénon equation, identifying the precise range of dimensions for which regularity holds. The thesis also addresses existence and multiplicity results for elliptic equations involving nonlinearities with spatially vanishing coefficients. Under suitable assumptions, the existence of multiple distinct solutions is proved using variational and topological methods.
