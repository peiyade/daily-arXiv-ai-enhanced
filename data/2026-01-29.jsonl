Together with the pointwise invariant $P+A$, these identities yield global existence, positivity, and long-time reduction to limiting $(S,R)$ kinetics with a unique globally attracting coexistence state. Neumann eigenmode reduction gives closed dispersion relations. The base $(S,R)$ reaction--diffusion block remains stable for all nonconstant modes for any $d_S,d_R>0$, excluding classical Turing destabilization.

Taking into account human intervention and temporal variation in rainfall, this paper develops a two-season switching faecal-oral model with impulsive intervention and free boundaries. In this model, the infection fronts are represented by fixed boundaries during the dry season and by moving boundaries during the wet season, with impulsive intervention occurring at the end of each wet season. The simultaneous introduction of impulsive intervention and seasonal switching creates new difficulties for mathematical analysis. We overcome these challenges through novel analytical techniques, resulting in a spreading-vanishing dichotomy and a sharp criteria governing this dichotomy. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the theoretical results and to visually illustrate the influence of seasonal switching and impulsive intervention. Our results mathematically explain that two factors, the duration of the dry season and the intensity of impulsive intervention are both positively correlated with effective disease control."}

As an application, we obtain local well-posedness for non-gauge-invariant nonlinearities with partially regular initial data. On the other hand, we extend refined Strichartz estimates for infinite systems of orthonormal functions, which generalizes the classical orthonormal Strichartz estimates on the torus by Nakamura [41] . As an application, we establish well-posedness for the Hartree equation for infinitely many fermions in some Schatten spaces. In the process, we develop several harmonic analysis tools for mixed Lebesgue spaces, e.g. Fourier multiplier transference principle, vector-valued Bernstein inequality, and vector-valued Littlewood--Paley theory for densities of operators, which may be of independent interest and complement the results of [45,55]."}
