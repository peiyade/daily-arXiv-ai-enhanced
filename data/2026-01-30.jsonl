For a class of initial data with specific decay at spatial infinity, we prove that the long-time dynamics of YMHF can be described by the initial data in a unified manner. As a consequence, the global solutions can exhibit blow-up, blow-down, and more exotically, {\\it oscillatory} asymptotic behavior at time infinity. This seems to be the first example of Yang-Mills heat flows with oscillatory behavior as $t\\to \\infty$."}

However, existing research primarily focuses on the single species Boltzmann equation, while investigations into gas mixtures with unequal molecular masses remain relatively limited. Notably, mixed gas studies have broader applications exemplified by Earth's atmosphere, composed of 78\\% nitrogen, 21\\% oxygen, and 1\\% trace gases, where the $N_2$ to $O_2$ molecular mass ratio is 28:32 (simplified as 7:8). This work addresses the Boltzmann equations for such mixtures with unequal molecular masses $(m^A\\neq m^B)$, establishing the global in time existence of classical solutions near Maxwellians for soft potentials ($-3<γ<0$) in a periodic spatial domain. Our analysis encompasses arbitrary molecular mass ratios. Our analysis encompasses arbitrary molecular mass ratios. The main contribution of this paper lies in the detailed characterization of the linear collision operator's structure and establishing estimates for the nonlinear terms under unequal mass conditions. Consequently, these results may help advance spectral analysis for soft potentials as well as $L^2,L^{\\infty}$ frameworks in future studies of multi-component Boltzmann equations."}

Using the method of Hilbert expansion, we first derive a bi-Maxwellian determined by the Euler-Poisson system of two fluids. To justify the convergence of the solution rigorously as the Knudsen number tends to zero, we sequentially calculate the first $2k-1$ terms of the expansion series $(k \\geq 6)$, and then truncate it, and express the solution as the sum of these first $2k-1$ terms and a remainder term. Within the framework of the $L_{x,v}^2-W_{x,v}^{1,\\infty}$ interplay established by Guo and Jang \\cite{[ininp]Guo2010CMP}, we construct a new weight function to estimate the remainder term in four different cases regarding the potential $γ$. Here, the particle masses $m^A, m^B > 0$ and their charges $e^A, e^B$ can be given arbitrarily. This causes the collision operator to exhibit asymmetric effects ($m^A \\neq m^B$), rendering the system of equations impossible to decouple. So, it adds difficulties to both $L^2$, $L^{\\infty}$ estimates for the remainder. Therefore, we adopt the framework of vector-valued functions and analyze the velocity decay rate of the operator $K_{M,2,w}^{α,c}$ to eliminate the singularity induced by small parameters in characteristic line iterations. Our results show that the validity time of the solution is $O(\\varepsilon^{-y})$, where $y$ is $-\\frac{2k-3}{2(2k-1)}$ when $-1 \\leq γ\\leq 1$, and it becomes $-\\frac{2k-3}{(1-γ)(2k-1)}$, when $-3 < γ< -1$. These results possess strong physical realism and can be applied to analyze gas flow dynamics in the daytime ionosphere at high altitudes above the Earth."}

To handle the boundary constraint, we use a harmonic lifting to reformulate the problem as an equivalent homogeneous system with a shifted nonlinearity.

The semigroup viewpoint also provides $L^\\infty$-contractivity and positivity preservation, which drive pointwise maximum principles and stability bounds. Furthermore, we analyze two prototypes. For the bistable RNDE, we derive an energy dissipation identity and, using a fractional weak maximum principle, obtain an invariant-range property that confines solutions between the two stable steady states. For the nonlocal Gray-Scott system with possibly different fractional diffusion orders, we prove that solutions preserve positivity.

Multistatic, in this context, means that the transmitters and receivers need not be co-located. The reflectivity is anisotropic if it depends on direction, and in the multistatic case this means incoming and outgoing direction. Travel-time problems can be formulated as generalized Radon transforms of integrals over isochrones, in the planar case ellipses with transmitter and receivers at foci. In a simplified case where transmitters and receivers are distant from the scene, isochrones can be approximated by straight lines. We relate this to tensor ray transforms, specifically the longitudinal ray transform of Sharafutdinov, and discuss the implication of its known null-space. In the volumetric case isochrones are spheroids and we relate the problem to the normal Radon transform of tensor fields."}

We prove that if a solution to a linear stochastic wave equation vanishes on one side of a characteristic surface $Γ$, then it must vanish in a full neighborhood of any point on $Γ$, provided the stochastic diffusion coefficient is non-degenerate. This result stands in sharp contrast to the classical Hörmander-type counterexamples for deterministic waves.\n  Furthermore, we extend the UCP to equations with non-homogeneous stochastic sources and establish a global unique continuation result from the interior of an arbitrarily narrow characteristic cone. Our proofs rely on a novel stochastic Carleman estimate, where the Itô diffusion term introduces a crucial positive energy contribution that is absent in deterministic models.\n  These findings demonstrate a qualitative difference between deterministic and stochastic hyperbolic dynamics and open new avenues for control theory and inverse problems in stochastic setting."}
