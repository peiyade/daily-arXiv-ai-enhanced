We then exploit these structural results to characterize, from a metaplectic perspective, classes of time-frequency representations satisfying prescribed structural properties. Finally, we discuss further implications for parabolic equations with complex quadratic Hamiltonians, we study the boundedness of their propagators on modulation spaces, we obtain estimates in time of their operator norms. Finally, we apply our theory to the study of propagation of Wigner singularities."}

Classical solutions, such as those proposed by Gringarten et al. 1975, rely on simplified assumptions and systematically overestimate thermal performance, which can lead to unrealistic engineering decisions.\n  This study presents a generalized analytical model for enhanced geothermal systems that explicitly captures thermal interactions between fractures while preserving analytical tractability.\n  The formulation is based on Greenś functions and reproduces realistic thermal behavior under conditions representative of fractured geothermal reservoirs. The resulting solution is computationally efficient and sufficiently simple to be implemented directly in standard spreadsheets, without requiring Laplace space transformations or numerical inversion algorithms.\n  The model is validated against numerical simulations performed using CMG STARS and Volsung software, showing close agreement in temperature evolution, including the effects of interacting fractures. Compared with classical analytical approaches, the proposed model corrects optimistic bias and provides more reliable predictions of production temperature and energy recovery.\n  These results have direct implications for geothermal feasibility studies, well design, and power forecasting, effectively bridging the gap between legacy analytical models and numerical or commercial engineering tools. Building on the analytical framework originally introduced by Gringarten et al. 1975, the proposed formulation generalizes classical heat transfer solutions to account for fracture interaction while retaining analytical simplicity and practical applicability."}

Our analysis covers games with displacement monotone or Lasry--Lions monotone data, as well as those with a small time horizon. By unconditional, we mean that all assumptions are imposed solely at the level of the Lagrangian and the terminal cost. In particular, we do not require any a priori regularity or structural assumptions on the additional fixed-point mappings arising from the control interactions; instead we show that these fixed-point mappings are well-behaved as a consequence of the regularity and the monotonicity of the data. Our approach is bottom-up in nature, unlike most previous results which rely on a generalized method of characteristics. In particular, we build a classical solution of the master equation by showing that the solutions of the corresponding $N$-player Nash systems are compact, in an appropriate sense, and that their subsequential limit points must be solutions to the master equation. Compactness is obtained via uniform-in-$N$ decay estimates for derivatives of the $N$-player value functions. The underlying games are driven by non-degenerate idiosyncratic Brownian noise, and our results allow for the presence of common noise with constant intensity."}

This solution preserves upper and lower bounds of the densities, and shows a certain decay of the BV norm (of the order of $t^{-1/3}$ for $t\\to 0$ -- if $ρ_0\\notin BV$, otherwise the BV norm is of course bounded -- and of the order of $t^{-1}$ as $t\\to\\infty$). This generalizes a previous result by Carlier and Poon, who only gave a full proof in one dimension of space and did not consider the case $ρ_0\\notin BV$.\n  The main tool consists in considering an approximated TV-JKO scheme which artificially imposes a lower bound on the density and allows to find a continuous-in-time solution regular enough to prove that the lower bounds of the initial datum propagates in time, and study on this approximated equation the decay of the BV norm."}

The equation arises from a two-dimensional fourth-order Prandtl system via an ansatz reduction, and its nonlinearity involves a nonlocal integral term. To close a Duhamel fixed-point argument, we need uniform $L^1$ bounds for the associated half-line biharmonic heat kernel. We establish uniform $L^1$ estimates for the kernel and its derivatives, and we show that the semigroup preserves spatial regularity under appropriate compatibility conditions, using an alternative representation derived by integration by parts. These kernel estimates yield local existence and uniqueness for the restricted model and allow us to construct solutions that blow-up in finite time."}

We apply the latter result to prove the spectral instability of the Taylor-Green vortex in two-dimensional ideal fluids. The linearized Euler operator at this steady state possesses different invariant subspaces, within which we apply our criterion to rule out or detect instabilities. We show linear stability of odd perturbations, for which the unstable spectrum can appear only on the real axis. We exclude this possibility by applying our stability criterion. Real instabilities, instead, exist and can be detected with the same criterion if we consider suitable rescalings of the Taylor-Green vortex. In the subspace of functions even in both variables, the problem is reduced to finding a single complex root of our stability function. We successfully locate this value by combining our general criterion with a rigorous computer-assisted argument. As a consequence, we fully characterize the unstable spectrum of the Taylor-Green vortex."}

As a key application, we characterize the ground state structure on the tadpole graph, revealing a mass-dependent phase transition.
