Namely, we study the interaction of a viscous incompressible flow with bulk poroelasticity, via a poroelastic interface. The configuration consists of two 3D toroidal subdomains connected via a plate interface, which permits elastic deformation and perfusive fluid dynamics. The governing dynamics comprise Stokes equations in the bulk fluid region, Biot's equations in the bulk poroelastic region, and the recent poroplate of Mikelić at the interface. Coupling occurs on the top and lower surfaces of the plate, and involves conservation of mass, stress balance, and a certain slip condition for the fluid free-flow.\n  We seek strong (and mild) solutions in the Hilbert space framework via the Lumer-Phillips theorem. The resolvent analysis employs a nonstandard mixed variational formulation which captures the complex, multi-physics coupling at the interface. We explicitly characterize the infinitesimal generator associated to the linear Cauchy problem and establish the generation of a $C_0$-semigroup on a suitably chosen finite-energy space. With the semigroup in hand, we may treat elastic nonlinearities for plate displacements through perturbation theory. These result parallel those for Biot-Stokes filtration systems, and complement the recently established weak solution theory for multilayer filtrations. The agency of the semigroup straightforwardly admits structural (plate) nonlinearity into the dynamics. Future stability and regularity analyses for multilayer filtrations are also made possible by these results, as well as a comparison of spectral and regularity properties between filtration configurations, and the elucidation of the mitigating poroplate dynamics as possibly regularizing and stabilizing."}

The proof uses a spatial-dynamics Hamiltonian formulation of the travelling-wave equations and a nonlinear change of variables that flattens the free surface while putting the symplectic form into Darboux coordinates. Near a distinguished curve in the vorticity--capillarity parameter space, the linearization has a two-dimensional center subspace; a parameter-dependent center-manifold reduction yields a canonical planar Hamiltonian system.

As Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems gain widespread adoption and show promise for improving both efficiency and safety, understanding how these waves evolve under ACC becomes increasingly important. Yet most existing analyses rely on steady-state metrics (e.g., equilibrium spacing) and neglect the ACC control-law parameters, such as feedback gains, that fundamentally shape higher-order traffic dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we embed the ACC control law directly into the momentum equation while retaining mass conservation law. The result is a higher-order macroscopic model whose dynamics are governed by a second-order partial differential equation equivalent to the linear ACC feedback law. Analyzing the flux Jacobian confirms that the system is strictly hyperbolic, thereby preserving anisotropy and ensuring physical consistency. The derivation also shows that traffic wave evolution depends on both the initial state and the ACC control parameters. We analyze wave-propagation characteristics, linear degeneracy, admissible discontinuities, and their connection to ACC string stability, with the corresponding derivations. Numerical experiments confirm that the second-order model yields markedly lower vehicle-pair speed deviations along wave paths than a first-order model subject to the same non-steady disturbances, underscoring both the necessity of a second-order treatment and the soundness of the proposed framework."}

The scheme introduces no spatial diffusion or mollification; all regularization originates solely from the marker selection mechanism.

This shows that the second part of the fundamental gap conjecture is wrong in every negatively curved manifold. This is significantly harder than in the previously known case of hyperbolic space because, due to the lack of symmetry, one has to study a true PDE, and not just an ODE."}

This system contains of a compressible Navier-Stokes system for the density and momentum of a fluid, and a transport equation for the potential temperature of the fluid. In stark contrast to the well-known Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) system where the temperature satisfies a parabolic type equation providing dissipative effect for the temperature and the density, the temperature in our NST system enjoys a transport equation which precludes a dissipative mechanism for the density, leading to significant different effects to the whole system. We first establish the global well-posedness of strong solutions to the compressible NST system in critical Besov spaces over $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 2$. Furthermore, by introducing the Mach number $\\varepsilon > 0$, we rigorously prove the low Mach number limit as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, showing that the solutions converge to that of the incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system. This singular limit holds globally in time, even for {\\it ill-prepared} initial data. To address the challenge posed by the lack of dissipation on the density and temperature, we develop a refined energy analysis and establish optimal time decay rates for strong solutions in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 3$. Notably, the density remains uniformly bounded in time, displaying asymptotic behavior fundamentally distinct from that in the NSF system, where the density possesses a dissipative structure via the momentum and temperature equations and exhibits temporal decay."}

The paper addresses continuous data assimilation for a model arising as a singular limit of the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with rotation driven by temperature gradient. The limit system preserves the essential physical mechanisms of the original model, while exhibiting a reduced, effectively two-and-a-half-dimensional structure. This simplified framework allows for a rigorous analytical study of the data assimilation process while maintaining a direct physical connection to the full compressible model. We establish well posedness of global-in-time solutions and a compact trajectory attractor, followed by the stability and convergence results for the nudging scheme applied to the limiting system. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be combined with a relative entropy argument to extend the assimilation framework to the full three-dimensional compressible setting, thereby establishing a rigorous connection between the reduced and physically complete models."}
