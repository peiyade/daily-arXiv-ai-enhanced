Following the framework established by McCann for binary stars \\cite{McC06}, we adopt a variational approach, and prove the existence of local energy minimizers with respect to the Wasserstein $L^\\infty$ metric, under the assumed equation of state $P(ρ)=Kρ^γ$ and under the condition that the mass ratio $m$ is sufficiently small, corresponding to a star-planet system. Such minimizers correspond to solutions of the Euler-Poisson system. We consider two cases. For $γ> 2$, we not only prove existence but also show, via scaling arguments, that the radii (to be precise, the bounds of the supports of the minimizers) tend to zero. For $\\frac{3}{2} < γ\\leq 2$, we estimate an upper bound for the (potential) expansion rates of the radii, and it turns out that the existence result remains valid in this case as well.

While spectral properties of the scalar NP operator and SPR dynamics for scalar waves are well-established, their vectorial counterparts in Maxwell's framework remain poorly understood.

The strong convergence of both $f$ and $f \\log f$ weighted by $|v|^k$ is proved by exploring some new a priori quantities of the velocity with the help of Tao's $L^p$ decomposition and the DiPerna-Lions compactness method.
