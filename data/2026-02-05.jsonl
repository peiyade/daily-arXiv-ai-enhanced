We frame these constructions in a common conceptual framework, where these function spaces arise as retracts of simple function spaces over phase space, through a projection associated with a wave packet decomposition. Finding appropriate function spaces to study a given PDE then consists in choosing a relevant wave packet decomposition. We provide a user guide to making such choices, and constructing the corresponding function spaces. This is done mostly by surveying recent constructions, but we also include a new construction, adapted to Schrödinger operators of the form $Δ- V$ for $V \\geq 0$, as a sneak peek into upcoming joint work with Dorothee Frey, Andrew Morris, and Adam Sikora."}

This modified model, obtained through a specific asymptotic scaling accessible only within the stochastic framework, captures non-hydrostatic effects while remaining within the primitive equations formalism. The resulting generalized hydrostatic model has been shown to be well-posed when the additional terms are regularized using a suitable filter for divergence-free noises under suitable assumptions.
