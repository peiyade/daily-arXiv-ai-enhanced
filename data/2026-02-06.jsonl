To do this, we prove an abstract multiplicity result which is based upon the Lusternik-Schnirelman method with the $S^1$-index. The corresponding result in the context of the Fadell-Rabinowitz index is proved in Ekeland and Lasry (Ann. Math., 112 (1980)). The main feature of our abstract result is that it allows us to consider nonsmooth functionals satisfying only a weak compactness condition well adapted to the Poincaré functional."}

Extremal solutions are $N$-soliton solutions that achieve the theoretical maximal amplitude and diverge as $N \\to \\infty$. We consider extremal solutions with the discrete eigenvalues randomly drawn from sub-exponential distributions, and identify two distinct universality classes, determined by the macroscopic structure of the spectrum: the Painlevé--III rogue-wave solution, where the eigenvalues take the form $λ_j = v_j + i μ_j$, and the Painlevé--V rogue wave solution, where $λ_j = -ζ\\, j + v_j + i μ_j$, with $0 < ζ< 1$. (In both cases, $μ_{j}$ and $v_{j}$ are subexponential random variables.) Universality can then be summarized as follows: independently of the specific distribution of the eigenvalues, the rescaled solutions converge locally to a deterministic profile governed by the Painlevé-III equation in the first regime, and the Painlevé-V equation in the second. These results demonstrate that the formation of Painlevé-type rogue waves is a universal phenomenon robust to randomness."}

To overcome these difficulties, instead of directly considering the HSM inequality on the upper half space, we establish the existence of an extremal for its equivalent version: Poincaré-Sobolev inequality on the hyperbolic space. We develop a novel duality theory of the minimizing sequences, the concentration-compactness principle for radial functions in the hyperbolic setting, which combines with the Helgason-Fourier analysis and the Riesz rearrangement inequality on the hyperbolic space, to resolve the lack of compactness issue.

The free boundaries $x=g(t)$ and $x=h(t)$ evolve subject to a ``preferred population density\" condition at the habitat edges. Analogous to the traveling wave solutions in the corresponding Cauchy problem, semi-wave solutions play a fundamental role in understanding the propagation phenomena governed by the free boundary problem here. But in contrast to the Cauchy problem, where the KPP condition plays a subtle role in the precise approximation of its solution (with compactly supported initial function) by the traveling wave solution with minimal speed, here we prove the existence and uniqueness of a semi-wave in a general monostable setting, and obtain a precise description of the convergence of the solution toward the semi-wave as time goes to infinity, where the KPP condition plays no special role. Previously, such a sharp result was proved for a free boundary model only when $f$ is autonomous ($f=f(u)$, see \\cite{D} or \\cite{DL15} for a related free boundary model), or a less precise result was obtained in the time-periodic case under an extra strong KPP condition on $f$ (see \\cite{MDW}, or \\cite{DGP} for a related free boundary model).

Such a model with free boundary conditions based on those of Cao et al. \\cite{fb27} was considered by several works. Inspired by recent works of Feng et al. \\cite{fb20} and Long et al. \\cite{fb5}, we propose a new free boundary condition, where the expansion rate of the epidemic region, determined by $h'(t)$ and $g'(t)$, is proportional to a linear combination of the outward flux of the pathogen \\(u\\) through the range boundary (as in \\cite{fb27}) and the weighted total population of infected individuals \\(v\\) within the region (as in \\cite{fb5}). We prove that the system under this new free boundary condition is well-posed, and its long-time dynamical behavior is characterized by a spreading-vanishing dichotomy. Moreover, we obtain sharp criteria for this dichotomy, including a sharp threshold in terms of the initial data $(u_0,v_0)$; and by studying a related eigenvalue problem, we also find a sharp threshold in terms of the diffusion rate, which complements related results in Nguyen and Vo \\cite{fb7}. This is Part $1$ of a two part series. In Part $2$, we will determine the spreading speed of the model when spreading occurs, and for some typical classes of kernel functions, we will obtain the precise rates of accelerated spreading."}

Within suitably generalized concepts of solvability, global existence of solutions is shown without any size restrictions on the data, and for a system actually more general than ($\\star$) by, inter alia, allowing the heat capacity $κ$ to depend on $Θ$. Apart from that, results on large time behavior are derived which particularly assert stabilization of $Θ$ toward a spatially homogeneous limit.\n  Besides on standard features related to energy conservation and entropy production, in its core parts the analysis relies on an evolution property of certain logarithmic refinements of classical entropy functionals, to the best of our knowledge undiscovered in precedent literature and possibly of independent interest."}

The $C^α$-norm of the distribution function blows up for every $α>0$, whereas its $L^{\\infty}$-norm remains uniformly bounded. In self-similar variables, the solution becomes asymptotically hydrodynamic - the distribution function converges to a local Maxwellian, while the hydrodynamic fields develop an asymptotically self-similar implosion whose profile coincides with a smooth imploding profile of the compressible Euler equations. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of a collisional kinetic model which is globally well-posed in the homogeneous setting, but admits finite time singularities for inhomogeneous data."}
