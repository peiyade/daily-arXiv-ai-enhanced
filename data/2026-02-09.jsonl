We examine isotropic as well as anisotropic media. Part of the survey deals with the so-called transmission spectrum, namely those wave numbers at which non-scattering potentially may occur. For wave numbers that are not transmission eigenvalues any incident wave leads to scattering, however, being at a transmission eigenvalue is far from su!cient to guarantee the occurence of non-scattering for even a single incident wave. For instance the inhomogeneity generically has to be smooth for non-scattering to occur. Similarly many smooth geometric shapes will be scattering for natural incident waves even at a transmission eigenvalue. Part of the survey discusses recent results of that nature."}

Moreover, they possess an intermediate regularity regime between the finite-energy weak solutions of Lions-Feireisl and the framework of Hoff. This particularly extends our previous half-plane case with Dirichlet boundary conditions (arXiv:2601.11852) to the whole-plane MHD coupling, and we also generalize the works of Hoff (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 55 (2002), pp. 1365-1407) and Suen and Hoff (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 205 (2012), pp. 27-58) by allowing vacuum states and unbounded density.

We show that this exponent is not optimal in the small-discrepancy regime once one of the functions is non-degenerate in the sense of having Monge-Ampère density bounded above and below by two positive constants.\n  We prove sharp quantitative estimates comparing two convex functions by the total variation of the difference of their Monge-Ampère measures: in dimensions $n\\ge 3$ the optimal dependence is quadratic in the natural mass scale, while in dimension $n=2$ the optimal dependence contains a logarithmic correction. These rates are shown to be optimal for all small discrepancies.\n  A key structural ingredient is a characterization of extremizers. We identify the pointwise minimizers and maximizers in the admissible class and prove that they are realized, respectively, by solutions to Monge-Ampère equations with an isolated singularity and by solutions to Monge-Ampère equations with a linear obstacle. This extremal description reduces the sharp estimates to a precise asymptotic analysis of these two model configurations.\n  Assuming further that the domain and the non-degenerate reference function are $C^{2,α}$ and uniformly convex, we obtain sharp pointwise two-sided asymptotics at interior points with explicit leading constants. Finally, in dimensions $n\\ge 3$ we establish a stability phenomenon: if the pointwise estimate is nearly saturated, then the measure discrepancy must concentrate near the point at the natural scale, quantifying rigidity of almost-extremal configurations."}

We obtain a sharp global uniform distance estimate from a convex function to the class of unimodular convex quadratic polynomials in terms of the total variation of its Monge-Ampère defect measure relative to Lebesgue measure. The estimate has an explicit optimal constant, and the inequality is strict in the regime of positive finite defect mass. In this regime we further prove asymptotic rigidity at infinity: every such convex function admits a unique quadratic asymptote with an explicit convergence rate, and satisfies a sharp affine invariant global Alexandrov estimate with equality if and only if the function solves the isolated singularity problem or the hyperplane obstacle problem. Standard subsolution methods are not well suited to this measure-theoretic setting and typically do not yield sharp constants, while the sharp Alexandrov estimates developed in our earlier work [19] play a central role here.\n  As an application, for entire solutions of Monge-Ampère equations with multiple (possibly infinitely many) isolated singularities, we give an explicit quantitative mass-separation condition ensuring strict convexity and hence smoothness away from the set of the isolated singularities."}

Our approach incorporates the global mass constraint directly into a refined matched-asymptotic framework complemented by a uniform spectral/linear analysis.

We consider a one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions for the population such that for small values of the parameter, the corresponding population density gets extinct as time passes, whereas for large values of them, the solutions exhibit a different behavior. We are interested in the intermediate set of values for the parameters, which are called threshold parameters. We prove the existence of a sharp transition between these two asymptotic dynamics; that is, there exists exactly one threshold value when the age-dependent birth rate of the population has compact support, utilizing the theory of monotone dynamical systems. The case when the birth rate is non-compactly supported is more intricate to deal with, as has been observed in several works, even if the nonlinear birth function is monostable. Nevertheless, the approach used in the present work turns out to be effective to handle a particular birth rate with noncompact support by translating the dynamics of the age-structured model into an integro-differential system."}

In this work, we demonstrate the global existence of strong solutions in the whole space case, without assuming the initial density to be small and regular: it suffices for it to be bounded and for the total mass to be finite. In passing, we obtain optimal decay estimates for the energy and dissipation functionals. As a corollary, we get a long-time description of the density.

The present stability result is similar to that proposed by one of us for the Navier-Stokes (NS) equation \\cite{glosta}; it is derived from a suitable formulation of the MHD equations proposed in our previous work \\cite{MHD}, emphasizing strong structural analogies with the NS case. A basic tool in the proof of the present stability result is a general theory of approximate solutions of the MHD Cauchy problem, that we developed in \\cite{MHD} on the grounds of previous results on the NS equation \\cite{smooth} and of the above structural similarities. We also introduce a class of Beltrami-type initial data for the MHD equations; although being arbitrarily large, these data produce global and decaying MHD solutions, fitting the framework of the present stability result. Comparisons with the previous literature on these subjects are performed."}
