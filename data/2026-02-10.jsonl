Due to the fact that the natural boundary condition on the magnetic field $H$ is the slip boundary condition, the Leray-Schauder fixed-point theorem, which have used to investigate the weak solution theory of the Navier-Stokes system, becomes invalid. To address such difficulty, we will invoke the Leray's approximation technique and the perturbation theory to seek a global weak solution to the Cauchy problem for MHD equations with large $L^3$-initial data. Our strategy provides a simple alternative (self-contained) proof of weak $L^3$-solution theory of incompressible Navier-Stokes system. Moreover, this weak solution is unique under some restrictions."}

The primary contribution of our work is threefold. For each class, we first establish the flexibility result (i.e., the existence of nontrivial admissible domains) via shape derivatives and local bifurcation theory.

This is a well-known difficulty of Helmholtz equations, but it has never been addressed in the quasiperiodic case. We tackle this issue by using the limiting absorption principle, which consists in adding some imaginary part (also called absorption) to the frequency in order to make the equation well-posed in L 2 , and then defining the physically relevant solution by making the absorption tend to zero. In previous work, we introduced a definition of the solution of the equation with absorption based on Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) boundary conditions. This approach offers two key advantages: it facilitates the limiting process and has a direct numerical counterpart. In this work, we first explain why the DtN boundary conditions have to be replaced by Robin-to-Robin boundary conditions to make the absorption go to zero. We then prove, under technical assumptions on the frequency, that the limiting absorption principle holds and we propose a numerical method to compute the physical solution."}

The main arguments are the modulation analysis, the bootstrap argument and the topological argument. The main novelty with respect to existing constructions of pure two-bubble solutions is the nonlocal interaction, which is more complex to analyze."}

This medium is a domain of thickness $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$, perforated by periodically distributed solid cylinders of size $\\varepsilon$. We consider the nonlinear stationary Navier-Stokes system with viscosity following the Carreau law. Using tools from homogenization theory and assuming that the Reynolds number scales as $\\varepsilon^{-γ}$, where $γ$ is a real constant, we prove the existence of a critical Reynolds number of order $1/\\varepsilon$, in the sense that the inertial term in the Navier-Stokes system has no influence in the limit if the Reynolds number is of order smaller than or equal to $1/\\varepsilon$ (i.e. $γ= 1$). In this case, we derive linear or nonlinear Darcy laws connecting velocity to pressure gradient. Conversely, we expect a contribution from the inertial term in the homogenized problem if the Reynolds number is greater than $1/\\varepsilon$. Finally, we propose a numerical method to solve nonlinear Darcy laws describing effective flow in the critical case and demonstrate its practical applicability on several examples."}
