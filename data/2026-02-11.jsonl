These solutions consist of strip-like regions of ions and electrons in phase space that propagate coherently and emerge from spatially homogeneous, velocity-dependent equilibrium layers. Depending on the geometry of the underlying equilibrium and on the selected Fourier mode, the bifurcation diagram exhibits either two or four solution branches. In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis. Finally, by means of an affine change of variables, we reveal a connection with the one-dimensional two-component Euler-Poisson system, which in turn enables the construction of traveling periodic waves of both small and large amplitude for that model as well."}

As a first result, we prove the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem with initial data near equilibrium in the full-frequency $L^{p}$-type critical Besov space \\emph{without relying on hyperbolic symmetrization}.

This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first result in compressible fluids that allows the initial velocity field to be highly oscillatory across all frequencies.\n  Furthermore, stemming from the Poisson coupling, the density and velocity exhibit distinct low-frequency behaviors. Motivated by this feature, we propose a general $L^p$-type low-frequency assumption and establish the optimal convergence rates of global solutions toward equilibrium. For a broad class of indices, this assumption yields faster decay than those obtained under the classical $L^1$ framework. To this end, we develop a time-weighted energy method, which is of interest and enables us to capture maximal decay estimates without additional smallness of initial data."}

This approximation framework allows the principal spectrum point to effectively substitute for the principal eigenvalue in characterizing the global dynamics of the nonlinear system.

Djitte", "Franck Sueur"], "title": "A Lions' type formula for some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of fractional harmonic functions", "comment": "11 pages", "summary": "In \\cite{Lions}, J. L. Lions considered a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of harmonic functions on a regular domain with Sobolev traces and obtained a formula that expresses the kernel of this space as an integral on the boundary of some derivatives of the Green function associated with the Laplace operator and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. This result was simplified and extended later by Englis, Lukkassen, Peetre, and Persson in \\cite{ELPL} to more general elliptic systems of even orders. In particular, they emphasized that the resemblance between Lions' type formula and the Hadamard variational formula only appears when the operator is of order $2$. In this paper, we investigate some RKHS of $a$-harmonic functions, where $a$ in $(0,1)$ refers to a fractional exponent of the Laplace operator. For such fractional order pseudo-differential operators, the local nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problem can be addressed by means of some $a$-transmission Sobolev spaces, which were introduced by Hörmander in the sixties and recently developed by Grubb in a series of papers. We deduce from these works a fractional Poisson formula, which is applied to obtain a Lions' type formula. We observe, in particular, that despite the order of the operator not being $2$, this formula resembles the Hadamard variational formula that we prove in the companion paper \\cite{sidy-franck_1}. As a complementary remark, we observe that for a family of RKHS associated with the steady Stokes system, a second order system, there is also a Lions' type formula for their two-point kernels, which turn out not to be similar to the corresponding Hadamard variation formula."}

By appropriately changing the signs of the function $a(x)$ on different static classes associated with $H$, we show that the maximal viscosity solution converges uniformly as $λ\\to 0^+$ and that all elementary solutions of the stationary equation \\[ H(x,Du(x))=c_0 \\] can be selected as limits. This provides the first result for selecting multiple viscosity solutions in vanishing discount problems beyond the usual monotonicity and integral assumptions, as long as $a(x)$ is positive on one static class. Our results highlight the crucial role of static classes in controlling the asymptotic behavior of viscosity solutions. Previously, under usual monotonicity assumptions, only a single solution could be selected (as discussed in \\cite{GL}), whereas our approach allows controlled selection of multiple solutions via static class-guided discount coefficients."}

Instead, it provides a direct method based on the relaxation of the problem in spaces of measures, constrained by the continuity equation: in this procedure, no gap is introduced due to the Ambrosio's superposition principle.\n  Within this weak convex framework, the validity of the null-minimization property is recovered through two further steps. First, a careful application of the Von Neumann minimax theorem yields an identification of the dual problem as a supremum over the set of smooth and bounded cylinder functions, solving an Hamilton-Jacobi-type inequality. Secondly, a suitable \"backward boundedness\" property of solutions to such Hamilton-Jacobi system gives a proper bound of the dual problem, ensuring that the minimum value of the original functional is actually zero.\n  The proposed strategy naturally extends to non-autonomous equations, encompassing time- and space-dependent dissipation potentials and time-dependent potential energies."}

The proof requires new quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equations, where the forcing is induced by the localisation. A by-product of these new estimates is an application to the Boussinesq equations, where we prove a quantitative blow-up rate for the critical $L^3$ norm of the velocity. We prove these quantitative estimates using Carleman inequalities as in [Tao21], and subsequently in [BP21a], with an additional forcing term.
