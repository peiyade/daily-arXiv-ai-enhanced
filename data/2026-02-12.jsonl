Time scales provide a unified framework that encompasses continuous, discrete, and hybrid settings. Under a Lipschitz condition on the nonlinearity bounded by the first eigenvalue, we prove existence and uniqueness using the contraction mapping theorem. Under a weaker one-sided growth condition, we establish existence using the Leray--Schauder fixed point theorem. To apply these functional analytic methods, we reformulate the problem as an operator equation, which requires developing the spectral theory for the Dirichlet Laplacian with mixed nabla-delta derivatives. We establish self-adjointness, positivity, and completeness of eigenfunctions, and the product eigenfunctions form a complete orthonormal basis in the n-dimensional setting."}

We study a family of fractional Hardy-type inequalities \\begin{equation} \\frac{c_{N,s}}{2}\\displaystyle\\iint_{Ω\\timesΩ}\\frac{(u(x)-u(y))^2}{|x-y|^{N+2s}}\\ dxdy-\\displaystyleλ\\int_Ωu^2\\ dx\\geq C\\displaystyle\\int_Ω\\frac{u^2}{δ^{2s}}\\ dx,~~~\\quad\\forallλ\\in\\mathbb{R},~~~~~~~(0.1) \\end{equation} with $u\\in C_c^\\infty(Ω)$ and $C=C(Ω,s,N,λ)>0$. We show that the best constant in $(0.1)$ is achieved if and only if $λ>λ^*(s,Ω)$, for some $λ^*(s,Ω)\\in\\mathbb{R}$. As a by-product, we derive in particular that the best constant in Hardy inequality $μ_{N,s}(Ω)$ is achieved if and only if $μ_{N,s}(Ω)<\\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$, with $\\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$ being the best constant for the fractional Hardy inequality in the half space. Moreover, if $Ω$ is a convex open set, we obtain a lower bound for $λ^*(s,Ω)$ in terms of the volume of $Ω$. Specifically, we prove that $λ^*(s,Ω)\\geq a(N,s)|Ω|^{-\\frac{2s}{N}}$ with an explicit constant $a(N,s)>0$. For general bounded $C^{1,1}$ open sets, we prove instead that $λ^*(s,Ω)\\geq0$ when $s$ is close to $\\frac{1}{2}$. The aforementioned result is proved after showing that $μ_{N,s}(Ω)=\\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$ for $s$ close to $\\frac{1}{2}$. In particular, we deduce that, whenever $s$ is sufficiently close to $\\frac{1}{2}$, the Hardy constant $μ_{N,s}(Ω)$ is never achieved, hence, behaves differently from that in the local case. This result is completely new in the fractional setting, and was known only for convex open sets for the full range $s\\in(\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$."}

For the linear system without rotation, stratification not only suppresses the lift-up effect but also exhibits certain dispersion effects, except for some points where degradation occurs, which will bring essential difficulties to nonlinear estimates. In contrast, when rotation is taken into account, we observe that this degeneracy in dispersion effects disappears; furthermore, we can derive dispersive estimates for the second and third components of the simple-zero mode within the velocity field. Additionally, we develop three good unknowns to minimize linear coupling terms as much as possible while mitigating growth induced by linear stretching terms; through constructing a series of multipliers, we achieve enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping effects. In our analysis of the nonlinear system aimed at establishing an improved stability threshold, we utilize quasi-linearization methods to rectify deficiencies in dispersive estimates related to both the first component of velocity and temperature, as well as address regularity issues along vertical directions caused by buoyancy forces and stratification. Consequently, we demonstrate that if initial perturbations in velocity and temperature satisfy $\\left\\|u_{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\|_{H^{N+2}\\cap W^{N+3,1}}+\\left\\|θ_{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\|_{H^{N+1}\\cap W^{N+3,1}}<δ\\mathbf{Re}^{-\\frac{14}{15}}$, for any $N\\geq 11$ and some $δ>0$ independent of $\\mathbf{Re}$, then the solution to the 3D Boussinesq equations with rotation is nonlinearly stable without transitioning away from the steady state."}

The key challenge stems from the degeneracy of $f(x)$, which leads to a more complex structure of the free boundary compared to the classical setting. To analyze it, we introduce the epiperimetric inequality developed by Weiss (Invent Math 138:23-50, 1999). Although this powerful tool was firstly introduced for the classical obstacle problem characterized by $f(x)>0$ in B_1, it also proves effective in our degenerate setting. This allows us to first obtain the decay rate of the Weiss energy for all blow-ups at the origin, which in turn implies the uniqueness of the blow-up profiles. With this uniqueness established, we then prove a very weak directional monotonicity properties satisfied by the solutions. This finally yields the regularity of the free boundary at the origin if the origin is a regular point."}

In this paper, we first provide a general method to obtain an explicit form of the relaxation tensor for inhomogeneous isotropic q-EBM. Then, we apply it to compute the eigenvalues of the free oscillation of Earth, assuming that Earth is a unit ball modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic q-EBM. So far, an analytical and systematic way to compute the eigenvalues of the FOE has been missing when modeling Earth as a q-EBM. In particular, we compute some clusters of eigenvalues (abbreviated by C-ev's). To be more precise, integrating by parts with respect to time of the q-EBM under the assumption that the initial strain is zero, the q-EBM becomes the sum of two terms. The first term, called the instantaneous term, doesn't have any integration with respect to time, but the second term, called the memory term, has such an integration. Then, consider the eigenvalues of the instantaneous part of the q-EBM. The eigenfunctions of C-ev's share the same eigenfunctions of the instantaneous part. However, the C-ev's may be shifted from the eigenvalues of the instantaneous part. Further, we analyze the structure of C-ev's and provide an inversion formula identifying the q-EBM from the C-ev's."}

As a consequence, we are able to treat the whole-space case with strictly positive far-field density. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that establishes global strong solutions for physically relevant compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space, without imposing any symmetry or special geometric assumptions on the initial data."}

When the covariance matrix of the source distribution commutes with that of the target, we derive more quantitative results that showcase exponential convergence toward the target when the source and the target share their support, but dropping to linear rates (O(t^{-1})) if the target is concentrated on a strict subspace of the source's support."}
