Dhanya", "Sarbani Pramanik"], "title": "Global Multiplicity and Comparison Principles for Singular Problems driven by Mixed Local-Nonlocal Operators", "comment": null, "summary": "We study a singular elliptic problem driven by a mixed local-nonlocal operator of the form \\begin{equation*}\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  -Δ_p u + (-Δ_q)^s u &= \\fracλ{u^δ} + u^r \\text{ in } Ω\\newline\n  u > 0 \\text{ in } Ω,\\ u &= 0 \\text{ in } \\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus Ω\n  \\end{aligned} \\end{equation*} where $p > sq$, $0<δ<1$ and $λ> 0$ is a parameter. The nonlinearity exhibits a singular power-type behavior near zero and displays at most a critical growth at infinity. We establish a global multiplicity result with respect to the parameter $λ$ by identifying a sharp threshold that separates existence, non-existence, and multiplicity regimes, a result that is new for singular problems involving mixed local-nonlocal operators. We also derive a Hopf-type strong comparison principle adapted to this nonlinear setting, which provides the main analytical tool for the global multiplicity result. Additionally, we investigate qualitative properties of solutions that are essential for the variational analysis, such as a uniform $L^{\\infty}$-estimate and a Sobolev versus Hölder local minimizer result. The analytical tools developed herein are of independent mathematical interest, with their applicability extending over a broader class of mixed local-nonlocal problems."}

We consider a family of energy functionals depending on a small parameter $\\varepsilon$ and on two fields, the displacement field and an eigendeformation field that approximates the crack in the material. By imposing a suitable irreversibility condition and adopting an incremental minimization scheme, we define a notion of quasi-static evolution for this model. We then show that, as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, these evolutions converge to a quasi-static crack evolution for the Griffith energy of brittle fracture, characterized by irreversibility, global stability, and an energy balance."}

Assume that we are given the evolution map sending each initial state $f\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ of the system to the corresponding final state at a fixed time $T$. The main question we address in this paper is whether this initial-to-final-state map uniquely determines the Hamiltonian $-Δ+V$ that generates the evolution. We restrict attention to time-independent potentials $V$ and show that uniqueness holds provided $V \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\cap L^q(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, with $q>1$ if $n=2$ or $q\\geq n/2$ if $n\\geq 3$. This should be compared with the results of Caro and Ruiz, who proved that in the time-dependent case, uniqueness holds under the stronger assumption that the potential exhibits super-exponential decay at infinity, for both bounded and unbounded potentials. This paper extends earlier work of the same authors, where uniqueness was obtained for bounded time-independent potentials with polynomial decay at infinity. Here we only require $L^1$-type decay at infinity and allow for $L^q$-type singularities. We reach this improvement by providing a refinement of the Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge resolvent estimate, which replaces the classical Agmon-Hörmander estimates used previously. Crucially, the time-independent setting allows us to avoid the use of complex geometrical optics solutions and thereby dispense with strong decay assumptions at infinity."}

Longmou-Moffo", "Mouhamadou Sy"], "title": "NLS with exponential nonlinearity on compact surfaces", "comment": "27 pages", "summary": "In this paper, we establish a probabilistic global theory in $H^1$ for the NLS with a Moser-Trudinger nonlinearity posed on compact surfaces. This equation is known to be the two dimensional counterpart to the classical energy-critical Schrödinger equations \\cite{CollianderIbrahimMajdoubMasmoudi2009}. The authors of \\cite{CollianderIbrahimMajdoubMasmoudi2009} also identified a trichotomy around the criticality of the equation based on the size of the total energy. In particular, for supercritical regimes (large energy), the equation is known to exhibit instabilities : the (uniform) continuity of the flow fails to hold. Large data distributional non unique probabilistic solutions have been obtained in \\cite{CasterasMonsaingeon2024}. The setting of \\cite{CasterasMonsaingeon2024} does not handle the uniqueness issue for the $H^1$-data and therefore could not define a flow for this regularity. Our main focus here is to build a single probabilistic framework that provides both existence, uniqueness, and continuity with respect to the initial data in $H^1$. Our uniqueness and continuity are based on the so-called Yudowich argument \\cite{Judovic1963}, and the probabilistic estimates are derived through the IID limit procedure \\cite{Sy2019}. Beyond the difficulties related to the borderline nature of the context, the major challenge resides in the need to satisfy two features that tend to play against each other : obtaining both continuity property of the flow and large data in the support of the reference measure. This made the design of the dissipation operator inherent in the method, as well as the analysis of the resulting quantities, particularly difficult. Regarding the supercritical regime, we show that a modified energy, with regularity similar to the original total energy, admits values as high as desired, suggesting that the constructed set of data contains supercritical ones."}
