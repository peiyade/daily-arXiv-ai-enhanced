Plaza"], "title": "Time-periodic oscillating Néel walls in ferromagnetic thin films", "comment": "29 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "This paper studies the existence, the structure and the spectral stability of time-periodic oscillating 180-degree Néel walls in ferromagnetic thin films. It is proved that time-periodic coherent structures do exist as solutions to the reduced model for the in-plane magnetization proposed by Capella, Melcher, and Otto (Nonlinearity 20 (2007), no. 11, 2519--2537) when a weak and $T$-periodic external magnetic field is applied in the direction of the easy axes of the film, perturbing in this fashion the well-known static 180-degree Néel wall. The linearization around this time-periodic Néel wall is constituted by a family of linear operators, parametrized by the time variable, which generates an evolution system of generators (or propagator) for the linear problem. Profiting from the stability of the static Néel wall, it is shown that the Floquet spectrum of the monodromy map for the propagator is contained in the complex unit circle, proving stability of the oscillating solution at least at a linear level."}

Our approach employs the modulated energy method together with weak convergence methods for nonlinear partial differential equations. This avoids the subtle spectrum analysis of the linearized operator at the so-called quasi-minimal orbits as well as the construction of asymptotic expansion. Moreover, it relaxes the assumption on the admissible initial data, which exhibits a phase transition along an initial interface. As a byproduct, we construct a weak solution to the limiting harmonic heat flow system with both minimal pair and Neumann-type boundary conditions across the interface."}

We consider a broad class of coupled nonlinearities with asymptotic critical behaviour in the sense of Brezis--Merle. The approach we follow is based on a blow-up analysis combined with Liouville--type theorems and integral estimates. Our results extend the scalar theory of uniform a priori bounds to the Hamiltonian case, and solve an open problem in [de Figueiredo D.G., do Ó J.M., Ruf B., Adv. Nonlinear Stud. 6 (2006), no. 2]. We believe that this approach is new in this setting. As a consequence of our a priori estimates, we prove the existence of a positive solution by means of Fixed Point Index theory."}

Under the weakened initial assumption $u\\in C^1(B_R) \\cap C^3(\\{|\\nabla u|>0\\})$, we establish sharp gradient bounds that depend on the oscillation of the solution. These estimates are applicable to a wide class of nonlinear terms, including the specific forms arising from the elliptic regularization of the inverse mean curvature flow ($f=\\varepsilon\\sqrt{1+|\\nabla u|^2}$ ), minimal surface equation ($f=0$) and several polynomial and logarithmic growth regimes. As applications, the gradient bounds imply uniform ellipticity of the equation away from the critical set,which allows one to apply classical elliptic regularity theory and obtain higher regularity of solutions in the noncritical region. Moreover, when the solution grows at most linearly, all cases of our results can be applied in Moser's theory to establish the affine linear rigidity of global solutions. This directly leads to the Liouville-type theorems for global solutions without requiring additional proofs."}
