Pure Appl. Math., 55(1), 30-70, 2002]. Their result relies on a definition of renormalized solutions involving a non-negative defect measure. In this paper, we address this issue for the inverse power law model in the case of hard potentials ($0 \\leq γ\\leq 1$). By exploiting the stronger coercivity estimates provided by hard potentials, we prove that the defect measure actually vanishes. Consequently, we establish the global existence of renormalized solutions for the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation with hard potentials in the standard sense, without any defect measure. Finally, we construct a counterexample showing that the approach developed for the hard potential case fails for soft potential model ($-3 < γ< 0$)."}

We consider this problem in a multi-dimensional half space and prove that if the slope of the initial data is close to that consistent with the contact angle, then there exists a unique global-in-time solution. In particular, we show the existence of a self-similar solution for a given behavior at the space infinity. We also show that our global solution converges to a self-similar solution as the time tends to infinity if the initial data is asymptotically homogeneous at the space infinity. No assumption on the size of the contact angle is imposed."}

We are interested in the behavior of viscosity solutions as the perturbation parameter vanishes and establish explicit convergence rates by adapting standard comparison arguments. Despite the possible singular or degenerate nature of the parabolic operator, our framework covers, in particular, both the normalized and the variational $p$-parabolic equations, providing quantitative estimates for perturbations of the exponent $p$ and limits arising from regularized approximations."}

Hopefully these examples could provide some enlightenments for the uniqueness and existence of Navier-Stokes equations, which are related to one Millennium Prize Problem of Clay Institute."}

We find solutions to this zero-mass problem in a Coulomb-Sobolev space using a new scaling based approach in critical point theory, by which we classify the possibly different behaviour of the nonlinearity $f$ at zero and at infinity in terms of the scaling properties of the left hand side of the equation. This is accomplished identifying a scaling invariant PDE which can be interpreted as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, for which a sequence of eigenvalues $\\{λ_k\\}$ is conveniently defined via the ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$-cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz. This index allows us to use new critical group estimates (and scaling-based linking sets) which might not be possible via the classical genus. Within a fairly broad set of parameters $N,α, p$ and class of assumptions on the local nonlinearity $f,$ we establish compactness results for an associated action functional and find multiple solutions as critical points, whose existence and number is sensitive to the ''resonance'' of $f$ with the sequence of eigenvalues for the scaling invariant problem, a construction which is at places reminiscent, in the present nonlinear setting, of the classical Fredholm alternative. As a byproduct of our analysis, letting $p\\neq 2$ allows us to capture general nonlinearities $f$ of Sobolev-subcritical, critical, or supercritical growth."}
