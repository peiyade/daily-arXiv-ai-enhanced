Coiculescu"], "title": "A Two-Sink Solution to the Self-Similar Euler Equations", "comment": "20 pages, 4 figures, 1 table", "summary": "We construct the first known example of a self-similar solution to the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations whose pseudo-velocity has more than one stagnation point. The solution is also a homogeneous steady state of the Euler equations. In contrast, any homogeneous steady state with bounded vorticity necessarily admits only a single stagnation point at the origin. Our construction develops cusps in the velocity along two lines passing through the origin, thereby allowing stagnation points other than the origin."}

The conditions are expressed in terms of the time-dependent coefficients and the spectral behavior of a normalized left-invariant vector field on the group. The three-sphere case is discussed in detail, leading to more explicit criteria, and the main results are further extended to operators defined on finite products of compact Lie groups."}

The main difficulty arises from the non-monotonicity of the pressure, which induces liquid-vapor phase transitions and consequently leads to both physical instabilities and mathematical non-uniqueness of solutions. It is shown that the occurrence of a phase transition is determined by whether the integral average of the specific volume lies inside the gas-liquid coexistence region defined by the Maxwell construction. By introducing an artificial viscosity, we construct an approximate system. When the integral average of the specific volume falls within the Maxwell region, the approximate solution converges, as the artificial viscosity tends to zero, to the equilibrium states given by Maxwell's construction, with the diffuse interface sharpening into a discontinuity. Conversely, if the integral average of the specific volume lies outside this region, the limiting solution remains outside as well, meaning that no phase transition occurs. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonicity of the pressure, combined with the condition that the integral average of the specific volume belongs to the Maxwell region, can act as a nucleation mechanism for phase transitions in the isentropic gas-liquid problem. Furthermore, the proposed approximation not only offers a regularized framework for describing phase transitions but also provides, from a rigorous mathematical viewpoint, a definition of admissible solutions related to phase transitions. The detailed proof relies on the artificial viscosity method, the calculus of variations, the anti-derivative technique, phase-plane analysis, and the level-set method."}

In this paper the case of negative Gaussian curvature is treated, a regime for which the bubbling behavior of approximate solutions is not so well understood. This is due to the possible appearance of blow-up solutions with diverging length and area. We give an existence result under assumptions on the curvatures which are somewhat natural, in view of some obstructions inherent to the problem. Our strategy is variational and relies on the study of certain families of approximated problems. By performing a refined blow-up analysis for solutions with bounded Morse index, we conclude compactness."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We exhibit a one-parameter family of first-order real elliptic systems on the plane whose ellipticity constant degenerates to zero as $δ\\to 0$, with condition number $κ= O(δ^{-2})$. For any fixed elliptic solver operating at finite precision, the parameter $δ$ can be chosen small enough to defeat the solver; no uniform numerical scheme based on the ellipticity constant alone can handle the entire family. Despite this, every member of the family is explicitly solvable -- and its initial value problem well posed -- by elementary means once a transport-theoretic invariant is identified. The cost of the transport solution is independent of $δ$. The example serves as a cautionary tale: the ellipticity constant alone does not determine the practical difficulty of a first-order PDE. Before invoking an elliptic solver, one should compute the transport obstruction $G$; its vanishing -- or smallness -- signals structure that standard elliptic methods miss entirely."}

Specifically, the weak solution $F=μ+μ^{\\frac{1}{2}}f$ is unique as long as it has finite energy, in the sense that the norm $\\|f\\|_{L^\\infty_t L^{r}_{x,v}}+\\|f\\|_{L^\\infty_t L^2_{x,v}}$ remains bounded (arbitrary large) for some sufficiently large $r>0$. Our approach applies dilated dyadic decompositions in phase space $(v,ξ,η)$ to capture hypoellipticity and to reduce the fractional derivative structure $(-Δ_v)^{s}$ of the Boltzmann collision operator to zeroth order. The difficulties posed by the large solution are overcome through the negative-order hypoelliptic estimate that gains integrability in $(t,x)$."}

However, when the domain and its boundary are unbounded, such a method is unavailable. In this paper, using the technique of sphericalization developed in the prior paper~[32], we establish the existence of solutions to the Dirichlet boundary value problem for $p$-harmonic functions in unbounded uniform domains with unbounded boundary when $1<p<\\infty$. We also explore the issue of whether such solutions are unique by considering $p$-parabolicity and $p$-hyperbolicity properties of the domain."}

These maps generalize families of maps introduced by Da Lio, Rivière and Schikorra and are related to harmonic maps with free boundaries. In our context, there is in general no monotonicity formula, which prevents the use of some classical methods. Despite this limitation, under natural assumptions on a Gagliardo-type energy, we succeed in proving a variety of small energy regularity results and improve on known results, even in the isotropic case for which some monotonicity formula is available. To this end, we exploit recent developments in the regularity theory of nonlocal equations and as a by-product, we explain how these results apply to classes of harmonic maps with free boundary and lead to new potential-theoretic estimates. As another application, we obtain higher differentiability results for the fractional harmonic map heat flow."}
