The constitutive relation involves densities of both fluids through an implicit function. The existence of global-in-time finite energy weak solutions to this system is known since the work of Novotný and Pokorný [Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 2020]. On the other hand, existence of local-in-time strong solutions is due to Piasecki and Zatorska [J. Math Fluid Mech.,, 2022]. In this paper, we establish the weak--strong uniqueness principle using the relative entropy method. In sharp contrast to the two-phase model of Baer-Nunziato type, the volume fraction of phase $+$ obeys a transport equation with an additional nonlinear term. This gives rise to troublesome terms in the relative entropy inequality. We are able to close the estimate by making an elaborate use of the structure of the system."}

To understand how these cognitive time scales shape population-level patterns, we propose and analyze a nonlocal population model with a cognitive map. The population density moves by a Fokker--Planck type diffusion driven by a cognitive map that stores a habitat quality information nonlocally. The map is updated through local presence with learning and forgetting rates, and we consider both truncated and normalized perception kernels.\n  We first study the movement-only system without growth. We show that finite perceptual range generates spatial heterogeneity in the cognitive map even in nearly homogeneous habitats, and we prove a lingering phenomenon on unimodal landscapes: for the fixed high learning rate, the peak density near the best location is maximized at an intermediate forgetting rate.\n  We then couple cognitive diffusion to logistic growth. We establish local well-posedness and persistence by proving instability of the extinction equilibrium and the existence of a positive steady state, with uniqueness under an explicit condition on the motility function. Numerical simulations show that lingering persists under logistic growth and reveal a trade-off between the lingering and total population size, since near the strongest-lingering regime the total mass can fall below the total resource, in contrast to classical random diffusive--logistic models."}

Furthermore, we also show that a ground state in the NLS equation with combined nonlinearities no longer provides a sharp threshold for global behavior such as scattering vs. finite time blow-up, instead the equation has a much richer dynamics."}

The fluid is subject to a uniform gravitational field and capillary forces acting along the free boundary. The interface between the fluid and the surrounding air is a free surface whose motion is driven by gravity, surface tension, and the fluid velocity field. The triple-phase intersections where the fluid, the air above the vessel, and the solid vessel wall meet are referred to as contact points, and the angles formed there are called contact angles. The model under consideration incorporates boundary conditions that allow for full motion of the contact points and dynamic contact angles. Under these conditions, \\cite{Yang} established the existence of equilibrium configurations for the model. These equilibria consist of a quiescent fluid occupying a domain whose upper boundary can be represented as the graph of a function in polar coordinates, minimizing a gravity-capillary energy functional subject to a fixed mass constraint. The equilibrium contact angles may take any value in $(0,π)$ depending on the choice of capillary parameters. In the present work, we develop a framework of a priori estimates for this model. We prove that, for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium, the system admits global solutions that converge exponentially fast to a (horizontally) shifted equilibrium state."}

A question of interest consists in transforming such ensemble bounds into individual controls on the flow ; this, among other uses, gives valuable information on the long-time behavior of the solutions. Toward such question of bounds transformation, Bourgain initiated a successful procedure that exploited the local wellposedness of the PDE, with an estimate of the time of size-doubling. In this note, we construct an estimation procedure which relies on a different local requirement. It turns out that this substitute is flexible enough to be possible to fulfill with the help of the ensemble bound itself.
