To address this issue, we develop a refined sliding method suited to mixed local-nonlocal operators. As key technical ingredients, we establish new generalized weighted average inequalities, narrow region principles, and maximum principles in bounded and unbounded domains.\n  These tools enable us to derive monotonicity and one-dimensional symmetry results for mixed elliptic equations in bounded domains, half-spaces, and the whole space, and to extend the analysis to parabolic equations with mixed time derivatives.

In the regime where the elastic constant tends to zero and the temperature is below the nematic-isotropic transition threshold, the bulk and surface energy enforce the energy minimizers to be uniaxial, with director fields lying in the tangent plane to the boundary in the sense of trace. We establish that the singular set of the limiting minimizer within the closure of the domain is a finite set by studying the associated harmonic map with a strong tangential boundary constraint.

When rescaling the thin domain, isotropic interaction ranges naturally become anisotropic, leading to the development of a theory for anisotropic nonlocal gradients with direction-dependent interaction ranges. Unlike existing nonlocal derivatives with finite horizon, which are defined via interaction kernels supported on balls of positive radius, our formulation is based on ellipsoidal interaction regions whose principal radii may vanish independently. This yields a unified framework that interpolates between fully nonlocal, partially nonlocal, and purely local models. Employing these tools, we present a $Γ$-convergence analysis for the nonlocal thin-film energies. The limit functional retains the structural form of the classical membrane energy, and the classical local model is recovered precisely when all interaction radii vanish."}

In particular, our framework includes hydrodynamic formulation of the nonlinear Schrödinger equations. The periodic waves we study exhibit on each period two pulses, one converging to a bright soliton and one converging to a dark soliton, when wavelength goes to infinity. We show that such waves, for sufficiently large periods, are spectrally unstable. To do so, we combine two approaches. The first one is to calculate the asymptotic expansion of the Hessian matrix of the action integral and concludes using arXiv:1505.01382 as in arXiv:1710.03936 . This shows instability when both limiting solitary waves are stable. The second approach studies the convergence of the spectrum when the period goes to infinity and is applied in remaining cases, when one of the solitary waves is unstable. To carry out the latter, we prove the convergence of an appropriate renormalization of the periodic Evans function as in arXiv:1802.02830 ."}
